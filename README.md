# MassiveComputing
Laboratory assigments for UC3M massive computing course. This course included: Architecture of computing platforms, massive Storage Systems, 
massive computing platforms for Big Data, paradigms for Data Massive Computing and frameworks for data-intensive computing.

## 1. Multithreading in python
Sessions from 3 to 7 and project 1 are about multithreading. Main goal to improve was image filtering time with various filters.

## 2. CUDA
Sessions from 9 to 17 and project 2 required using gpu. We performed tiled convolution on same images as earlier, but this time the calculations were done by gpu, not cpu.

## 3. Databrics & Spark
Sessions starting with 19 and project 3 were realised in Azure Databrics. We worked with data loading, data analysis, RDDs, as long as we performed some ML approaches to the data. Final task 
was implementing Page Rank algorithm invented by Google founders: Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Data provided was wikipedia dataset, containing almost 6 milion records.

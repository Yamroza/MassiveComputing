CPU - central processing unit
L1 cache - pamięć pierwszego poziomu
system bus - magistrala
L3 - main memory
L4 - hard disk

Distance is important in this case

+ Why is it nice to put multiple cores in the same processor?

Because the distance that signal has to go is shorter, everything is in a small physical space and because of is faster. They can share common signals in the same chip.

+ What is the problem in putting multiple cores in one processor? (one chip, synonym)

Size is growing so the distance is growing, so our pro is lost. Also 

Chips work at 500W, so 100A. It means really wide transmission line between elements. It also produces heat and our chip (computer) will burn.  


Fetch Instruction -> Decode instruction -> Fetch data -> Execute instruction -> Write back -> Save result  (+ Write back -> Fetch data) = 6 cycles

## Slajd 4

Wszystkie procesory porozumiewają się na zasadzie każdy z każdym (strzałki na obrazku)
Z każdego procesora leci strałka do MCU - Memory Control Unit. Every processor has a memory bank.

- Advantages: 

We will need to control IO and how to assign tasks to processors. 

## Slajd 6 

SIMD - dot product in vector multiplying. Instruction is multiplying, data is many vectors.

### Multitasking:
Are human multitasking?
We can breath and walk at the same time sometimes, but watching TV with cooking don't go well together. Same computer - while doing things simultaneously we have to switch between tasks. 
How computer can play music and operate word at the same time? It loads music between our clicks (this mf is fast)

### Multitasking:
Computer with >=2 cores may be multi-processing. Many tasks and simultaneously

Example: 6 cores & 12 threads - every core has 2 threads: A and B. And on every one when A is executed, B waits.
In our high performance programming we want to achieve 100% attention of a core, so not to give the other thread any time.

### CPU Core & Processor:
processors include cores

It totally won't take 1 year bcs everything się rozjebie it's not possible

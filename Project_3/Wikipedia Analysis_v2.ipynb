It first appeared in [[Ishirō Honda]]'s 1954 film ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''. Since then, Godzilla has gone on to become a worldwide pop culture icon, appearing in numerous media including [[Godzilla video games|video games]], novels, [[Godzilla (comics)|comic books]], [[Godzilla (franchise)#Television|television shows]], 28 films produced by [[Toho]]  and [[Godzilla_(franchise)#American_films|two Hollywood films]]. The character is commonly alluded to by the title '''King of the Monsters''', a phrase first used in ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'', the Americanized version of Honda's original 1954 film.  With the [[nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon 5]]'' incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for [[nuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|Brothers|2009|p=}} As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones portraying Godzilla as a hero while other plots still portrayed Godzilla as a destructive monster; sometimes the lesser of two threats who plays the defender by default but is still a danger to humanity.  ==Overview==  ===Name=== {{nihongo|''Gojira''|ゴジラ}} is a [[portmanteau]] of the Japanese words: {{nihongo3|\"[[gorilla]]\"|ゴリラ|gorira}}, and {{nihongo3|\"[[whale]]\"|鯨（クジラ）|kujira}}, which is fitting because in one planning stage, Godzilla was described as \"a cross between a gorilla and a whale\",{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=22}} alluding to his size, power and aquatic origin.

The Japanese pronunciation of the name is {{IPA-ja|ɡodʑiɽa||Godzilla.ogg}}; the Anglicized form is {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ɒ|d|ˈ|z|ɪ|l|ə}}, with the first syllable pronounced like the word \"god\", and the rest rhyming with \"gorilla\". In the [[Hepburn romanization]] system, Godzilla's name is rendered as \"Gojira\", whereas in the [[Kunrei romanization]] system it is rendered as \"Gozira\".  ===Characteristics=== <!-- This article was pared-down and heavily rewritten because it was a bloated with unsourced information and written in an inappropriate in-universe tone.

Taking inspiration from ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', special effects artist [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] had initially wanted Godzilla to be portrayed via stop-motion, but prohibitive deadlines and a lack of experienced animators in Japan at the time made suitmation more practical. The first suit consisted of a body cavity made of thin wires and bamboo wrapped in chicken wire for support, and covered in fabric and cushions, which were then coated in latex. The first suit was held together by small hooks on the back, though subsequent Godzilla suits incorporated a zipper. Its weight was in excess of {{convert|100|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"godziszewski\"/> Prior to 1984, most Godzilla suits were made from scratch, thus resulting in slight design changes in each film appearance.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=16-17}} The most notable changes during the 1960s-70s were the reduction in Godzilla's number of toes and the removal of the character's external ears and prominent fangs, features which would later be reincorporated in the Godzilla designs from ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'' (1984) onwards.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=163-164}} The most consistent Godzilla design was maintained from ''[[Godzilla vs Biollante]]'' (1989) to ''[[Godzilla vs Destoroyah]]'' (1995), when the suit was given a cat-like face and double rows of teeth.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=254-257}} Several suit actors had difficulties in performing as Godzilla, due to the suits' weight, lack of ventilation and diminished visibility.<ref name=\"godziszewski\"/> [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] in particular, who portrayed Godzilla from 1984 to 1995, described how the Godzilla suits he wore were even heavier and hotter than their predecessors, because of the incorporation of animatronics.<ref name=\"clements2010\">Clements, J.

The suits were similar to those used in the Toho films, with the actors' heads being located in the monster's neck region, and the facial movements controlled via animatronics.

She is the author of seven novels, including ''[[Adam Bede]]'' (1859), ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'' (1860), ''[[Silas Marner]]'' (1861), ''[[Middlemarch]]'' (1871–72), and ''[[Daniel Deronda]]'' (1876), most of them set in provincial England and known for their [[realism (arts)|realism]] and psychological insight.  She used a male pen name, she said, to ensure her works would be taken seriously. Female authors were published under their own names during Eliot's life, but she wanted to escape the stereotype of women only writing lighthearted romances. She also wished to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as an editor and critic. An additional factor in her use of a pen name may have been a desire to shield her private life from public scrutiny and to prevent scandals attending her relationship with the married [[George Henry Lewes]], with whom she lived for over 20 years.<ref>Karl, Frederick R.

She also had a half-brother, Robert (1802–64), and half-sister, Fanny (1805–82), from her father's previous marriage to Harriet Poynton (?1780–1809). Robert Evans, of Welsh ancestry, was the manager of the [[Arbury Hall]] Estate for the [[Newdigate family]] in Warwickshire, and Mary Ann was born on the estate at South Farm. In early 1820 the family moved to a house named Griff, between [[Nuneaton]] and [[Bedworth]].  The young Evans was obviously intelligent and a voracious reader. Because she was not considered physically beautiful, and thus not thought to have much chance of marriage, and because of her intelligence, her father invested in an education not often afforded women.<ref>Karl, Frederick R.

Norton, 1995. pp. 24–25</ref> From ages five to nine, she boarded with her sister Chrissey at Miss Latham's school in [[Attleborough, Warwickshire|Attleborough]], from ages nine to thirteen at Mrs. Wallington's school in Nuneaton, and from ages thirteen to sixteen at Miss Franklin's school in Coventry. At Mrs. Wallington's school, she was taught by the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Maria Lewis—to whom her earliest surviving letters are addressed. In the religious atmosphere of the Miss Franklin's school, Evans was exposed to a quiet, disciplined belief opposed to evangelicalism.<ref>Karl, Frederick R. ''George Eliot: Voice of a Century''. Norton, 1995. p. 31</ref>  After age sixteen, Evans had little formal education.<ref>Karl, Frederick R. George ''Eliot: Voice of a Century.''  Norton, 1995. p. 52</ref> Thanks to her father's important role on the estate, she was allowed access to the library of Arbury Hall, which greatly aided her self-education and breadth of learning. Her classical education left its mark; Christopher Stray has observed that \"George Eliot's novels draw heavily on Greek literature (only one of her books can be printed correctly without the use of a Greek typeface), and her themes are often influenced by Greek tragedy\".<ref>Christopher Stray ''Classics Transformed'', p. 81</ref> Her frequent visits to the estate also allowed her to contrast the wealth in which the local landowner lived with the lives of the often much poorer people on the estate, and different lives lived in parallel would reappear in many of her works. The other important early influence in her life was religion. She was brought up within a [[low church]] [[Anglican]] family, but at that time the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] was an area with a growing number of [[English Dissenters|religious dissenters]].  === Move to Coventry === In 1836 her mother died and Evans (then 16) returned home to act as housekeeper, but she continued correspondence with her tutor Maria Lewis. When she was 21, her brother Isaac married and took over the family home, so Evans and her father moved to [[Foleshill]] near [[Coventry]]. The closeness to Coventry society brought new influences, most notably those of Charles and Cara Bray. [[Charles Bray]] had become rich as a ribbon manufacturer and had used his wealth in the building of schools and in other philanthropic causes. Evans, who had been struggling with religious doubts for some time, became intimate friends with the progressive, free-thinking Brays, whose \"Rosehill\" home was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. The people whom the young woman met at the Brays' house included [[Robert Owen]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Harriet Martineau]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal theologies and to writers such as [[David Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical stories. In fact, her first major literary work was an English translation of Strauss's ''The Life of Jesus'' (1846), which she completed after it had been left incomplete by another member of the \"Rosehill Circle\". As a product of their friendship, Bray published some of Evans's earliest writing, such as reviews, in his newspaper the ''[[Coventry Herald and Observer]]''.<ref name = Eliot>{{cite journal| article =George Eliot's Earliest Prose: The Coventry \"Herald\" and the Coventry Fiction| first =Kathleen | last= McCormick| journal =Victorian Periodicals Review| volume = 19| number = 2 | date = Summer 1986| pages = 57–62| jstor =20082202}}</ref>  When Evans began to question her religious faith, her father threatened to throw her out of the house, but his threat was not carried out. Instead, she respectfully attended church and continued to keep house for him until his death in 1849, when she was 30. Five days after her father's funeral, she travelled to Switzerland with the Brays. She decided to stay on in [[Geneva]] alone, living first on the lake at Plongeon (near the present-day United Nations buildings) and then on the second floor of a house owned by her friends François and Juliet d'Albert Durade on the rue de Chanoines (now the rue de la Pelisserie). She commented happily that, \"one feels in a downy nest high up in a good old tree\". Her stay is commemorated by a plaque on the building. While residing there, she read avidly and took long walks in the beautiful Swiss countryside, which was a great inspiration to her. François Durade painted her portrait there as well.<ref>Hardy BN. ''George Elliot: A Critic's Biography''. Continuum. London 2006 pp42-45.</ref>  === Move to London and editorship of the ''Westminster Review'' === On her return to England the following year (1850), she moved to London with the intent of becoming a writer, and she began referring to herself as Marian Evans. She stayed at the house of [[John Chapman (publisher)|John Chapman]], the radical publisher whom she had met earlier at Rosehill and who had published her Strauss translation. Chapman had recently purchased the campaigning, left-wing journal ''[[The Westminster Review]]'', and Evans became its assistant editor in 1851. Although Chapman was officially the editor, it was Evans who did most of the work of producing the journal, contributing many essays and reviews beginning with the January 1852 issue and continuing until the end of her employment at the Review in the first half of 1854.<ref>Ashton, Rosemary. ''George Eliot: A Life''. London: Penguin, 1997. 88ff. p110.</ref>  Women writers were common at the time, but Evans's role as the female editor of a literary magazine was quite unusual. She was not considered to be a beautiful or even an attractive woman. According to Henry James, ''She had a low forehead, a dull grey eye, a vast pendulous nose, a huge mouth full of uneven teeth and a chin and jawbone 'qui n'en finissent pas'... Now in this vast ugliness resides a most powerful beauty which, in a very few minutes, steals forth and charms the mind, so that you end, as I ended, in falling in love with her. Yes, behold me in love with this great horse-faced bluestocking.''<ref> Henry James, in a letter to his father, published in Edel, Leon (ed.) ''Henry James: Selected Letters'' (1990)</ref> During this period she formed a number of embarrassing, unreciprocated emotional attachments, including one with Chapman (who was married but lived with both his wife and his mistress), and another with [[Herbert Spencer]].  === Relationship with George Lewes === [[File:George Eliot by Samuel Laurence.jpg|thumb|Portrait of George Eliot by [[Samuel Laurence]], c. 1860]]  The philosopher and critic [[George Henry Lewes]] (1817–78) met Evans in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes was already married to Agnes Jervis. They had an [[open marriage]], and in addition to the three children they had together, Agnes also had four children by [[Thornton Leigh Hunt]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Henry|first= Nancy|title= The Cambridge Introduction to George Eliot|year= 2008|publisher= Cambridge|location= Cambridge|pages=6}}</ref> Because Lewes allowed himself to be falsely named as the father on the birth certificates of Jervis's illegitimate children, he was considered to be complicit in adultery, and therefore he was not legally able to divorce her.  In July 1854, Lewes and Evans travelled to [[Weimar]] and Berlin together for the purpose of research. Before going to Germany, Evans continued her theological work with a translation of Feuerbach's ''Essence of Christianity'', and while abroad she wrote essays and worked on her translation of [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', which she completed in 1856, but which was not published in her lifetime.<ref>Hughes, Kathryn, ''George Eliot: The Last Victorian'', p. 168.</ref>  The trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon for Evans and Lewes, and they now considered themselves married, with Evans calling herself Marian Evans Lewes, and referring to Lewes as her husband. It was not unusual for men and women in Victorian society to have affairs; [[Charles Bray]], John Chapman, [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Wilkie Collins]] all had extra-marital relationships, though they were much more discreet than Lewes and Evans were. It was this lack of discretion and their public admission of the relationship which created accusations of polygamy and earned them the moral disapproval of English society .  === First publication === [[File:George Eliot BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph ([[:en:albumen print|albumen print]]) of George Eliot, c. 1865]] While continuing to contribute pieces to the ''Westminster Review'', Evans resolved to become a novelist, and she set out a manifesto for herself in one of her last essays for the ''Review'', \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\"<ref>[http://webscript.princeton.edu/~mnoble/eliot-texts/eliot-sillynovels.html \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\"] text from ''The Westminster Review'' Vol. 66 old series, Vol. 10 new series (October 1856): 442–61.</ref> (1856). The essay criticised the trivial and ridiculous plots of contemporary fiction by women. In other essays, she praised the [[realism (arts)|realism]] of novels that were being written in Europe at the time, and it became clear in her subsequent fiction that she placed an emphasis on realistic storytelling. She also adopted a nom-de-plume, the one for which she would become known: George Eliot. This pen-name was said by some to be an homage to George Lewes. In addition to adopting his first name, the last name, Eliot, could possibly have been a code for \"to L&mdash;I owe it\".<ref>Mead, Rebecca, ''My Life in Middlemarch''. New York: Crown Publishers, 2014, p. 178</ref>  In 1857, when she was 37, \"The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton\", the first of the ''[[Scenes of Clerical Life]]'', was published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' and, along with the other ''Scenes'', it was well received (it was published in book form early in 1858). Her first complete novel, published in 1859, was ''[[Adam Bede]]''; it was an instant success, but it prompted intense interest in who this new author might be. ''Scenes of Clerical Life'' was widely believed to have been written by a country [[parson]] or perhaps the wife of a parson. With the release of the incredibly popular ''Adam Bede'', speculation increased, and there was even a pretender to the authorship, one Joseph Liggins. In the end, the real George Eliot stepped forward: Marian Evans Lewes admitted she was the author. The revelations about Eliot's private life surprised and shocked many of her admiring readers, but this did not affect her popularity as a novelist. Eliot's relationship with Lewes afforded her the encouragement and stability she so badly needed to write fiction, and to ease her self-doubt, but it would be some time before they were accepted into polite society. Acceptance was finally confirmed in 1877 when they were introduced to [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]], the daughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. The queen herself was an avid reader of all of George Eliot's novels and was so impressed with ''Adam Bede'' that she commissioned the artist [[Edward Henry Corbould]] to paint scenes from the book.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/6794 Rosemary Ashton, \"Evans, Marian &#91;George Eliot&#93; (1819–1880)\"], (Later Works) ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2008</ref>  [[File:George Eliot 31 Wimbledon Park Road blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, Holly Lodge, 31 Wimbledon Park Road, London]] After the success of ''Adam Bede'', Eliot continued to write popular novels for the next fifteen years. Within a year of completing ''Adam Bede'', she finished ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'', dedicating the manuscript: \"To my beloved husband, George Henry Lewes, I give this MS. of my third book, written in the sixth year of our life together, at Holly Lodge, South Field, Wandsworth, and finished 21 March 1860.\"  Her last novel was ''[[Daniel Deronda]]'', published in 1876, after which she and Lewes moved to [[Witley]], Surrey. By this time Lewes's health was failing, and he died two years later, on 30 November 1878. Eliot spent the next two years editing Lewes's final work, ''Life and Mind'', for publication, and she found solace and companionship with [[John Walter Cross]]<ref>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/John_Walter_Cross</ref>, a Scottish commission agent<ref>1881 census</ref> whose mother had recently died.  === Marriage to John Cross and death === [[File:Eliot George grave.jpg|thumb|Eliot's grave in [[Highgate Cemetery]]]]  On 16 May 1880 Eliot courted controversy once more by marrying John Cross, a man twenty years her junior, and again changing her name, this time to Mary Anne Cross. The legal marriage at least pleased her brother Isaac, who had broken off relations with her when she had begun to live with Lewes, but now sent congratulations. While the couple was honeymooning in Venice, Cross, in a fit of depression, jumped from the hotel balcony into the Grand Canal. He survived, and the newlyweds returned to England. They moved to a new house in Chelsea, but Eliot fell ill with a throat infection. This, coupled with the kidney disease she had been afflicted with for several years, led to her death on 22 December 1880 at the age of 61.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/eliot_george.shtml| title = George Eliot | date = 15 October 2009| accessdate =30 December 2009| publisher=BBC History}}</ref>  Eliot was not buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] because of her denial of the Christian faith and her \"irregular\" though monogamous life with Lewes. She was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]] (East), Highgate, London, in the area reserved for religious dissenters and agnostics, beside the love of her life, [[George Henry Lewes]]; Karl Marx's grave is nearby. In 1980, on the centenary of her death, a memorial stone was established for her in the [[Poets' Corner]].  Several buildings in her birthplace of Nuneaton are named after her or titles of her novels. These include The George Eliot School (previously George Eliot Community School) and Middlemarch Junior School. In 1948, Nuneaton Emergency Hospital was renamed George Eliot Hospital in her honour.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=187-cr2765&cid=0#0 Nuneaton Emergency Hospital at the National Archives]</ref> George Eliot Road, in [[Foleshill]], Coventry was also named in her honour and Nuneaton motorcycle manufacturer [[John Birch (engineer)|John Birch]] named one of his motorcycles after her.  A statue of Eliot is in Newdegate Street, Nuneaton, and [[Nuneaton Museum & Art Gallery]] has a display of artifacts related to her.  ==Literary assessment== [[File:George Eliot 7.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Frederick William Burton]], 1864]]  Throughout her career, Eliot wrote with a politically astute pen. From ''[[Adam Bede]]'' to ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'' and ''[[Silas Marner]]'', Eliot presented the cases of social outsiders and small-town persecution. ''[[Felix Holt, the Radical]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Jubal]]'' were overtly political, and political crisis is at the heart of ''[[Middlemarch]]'', in which she presents the stories of a number of denizens of a small English town on the eve of the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill of 1832]]; the novel is notable for its deep psychological insight and sophisticated character portraits. The roots of her realist philosophy can be found in her review of [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in ''[[Westminster Review]]'' in 1856.  Readers in the Victorian era particularly praised her books for their depictions of rural society, for which she drew on her own early experiences, and she shared with [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] the belief that there was much interest and importance in the mundane details of ordinary country lives. Eliot did not, however, confine herself to her [[bucolic]] roots. ''[[Romola]]'', a historical novel set in late 15th century [[Florence]] and touching on the lives of several real persons such as the priest [[Girolamo Savonarola]], displays her wider reading and interests. In ''The Spanish Gypsy'', Eliot made a foray into verse, creating a work whose initial popularity has not endured.  The religious elements in her fiction also owe much to her upbringing, with the experiences of Maggie Tulliver from ''The Mill on the Floss'' sharing many similarities with the young Mary Ann Evans's own development. When Silas Marner is persuaded that his alienation from the church means also his alienation from society, the author's life is again mirrored with her refusal to attend church. She was at her most autobiographical in ''Looking Backwards'', part of her final printed work ''[[Impressions of Theophrastus Such]]''. By the time of ''[[Daniel Deronda]]'', Eliot's sales were falling off, and she faded from public view to some degree. This was not helped by the biography written by her husband after her death, which portrayed a wonderful, almost saintly, woman totally at odds with the scandalous life people knew she had led. In the 20th century she was championed by a new breed of critics, most notably by [[Virginia Woolf]], who called ''Middlemarch'' \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people\".<ref>Woolf, Virginia. \"George Eliot.\" ''The Common Reader''. New York: Harcourt, Brace, and World, 1925. pp. 166–76.</ref> Twentieth-century literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] placed Eliot among the [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|greatest Western writers of all time]].<ref>[[Harold Bloom|Bloom, Harold]]. 1994.

Heliox has been used medically since the 1930s, and although the medical community adopted it initially to alleviate symptoms of upper airway obstruction, its range of medical uses has since expanded greatly, mostly because of the low density of the gas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barach AL, Eckman M |title=THE EFFECTS OF INHALATION OF HELIUM MIXED WITH OXYGEN ON THE MECHANICS OF RESPIRATION |journal=J.

It does this by two mechanisms: # increased tendency to [[laminar flow]]; # reduced resistance in [[turbulent flow]]. Heliox has a similar viscosity to air but a significantly lower density (0.5&nbsp;g/l versus 1.2&nbsp;5g/l at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]). Flow of gas through the airway comprises laminar flow, transitional flow and turbulent flow. The tendency for each type of flow is described by the [[Reynolds number]]. Heliox's low density produces a lower Reynolds number and hence higher probability of laminar flow for any given airway. Laminar flow tends to generate less resistance than turbulent flow.  In the small airways where flow is laminar, resistance is proportional to gas viscosity and is not related to density and so heliox has little effect. The [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation]] describes laminar resistance. In the large airways where flow is turbulent, resistance is proportional to density, so heliox has a significant effect.  Heliox has been used medically since the early 1930s. It was the mainstay of treatment in acute [[asthma]] before the advent of [[bronchodilators]]. Currently, heliox is mainly used in conditions of large airway narrowing (upper airway obstruction from tumors or foreign bodies and [[vocal cord dysfunction]]). There is also some use of heliox in conditions of the medium airways ([[croup]], asthma and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]).  Patients with these conditions may suffer a range of symptoms including [[dyspnea]] (breathlessness), hypoxemia (below-normal oxygen content in the arterial blood) and eventually a weakening of the respiratory muscles due to [[exhaustion]], which can lead to respiratory failure and require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Heliox may reduce all these effects, making it easier for the patient to breathe.<ref name=\"BOCMdata\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bocmedical.co.uk/product_information/Medical_Helium_Oxygen_Mix_172.pdf |title=Heliox data sheet |author=BOC Medical}}</ref> Heliox has also found utility in the weaning of patients off mechanical ventilation, and in the nebulization of inhalable drugs, particularly for the elderly.<ref name=\"AnaesUK\">{{cite journal |author=Lee DL, Hsu CW, Lee H, Chang HW, Huang YC |title=Beneficial effects of albuterol therapy driven by heliox versus by oxygen in severe asthma exacerbation |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=820–7 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16141015 |doi=10.1197/j.aem.2005.04.020 |url=http://www.anaesthesiauk.com/article.aspx?articleid=100375 |accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> Research has also indicated advantages in using helium–oxygen mixtures in delivery of [[anaesthesia]].<ref name=\"BJA\">{{cite journal |author=Buczkowski PW, Fombon FN, Russell WC, Thompson JP |title=Effects of helium on high frequency jet ventilation in model of airway stenosis |journal=Br J Anaesth |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=701–5 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16143576 |doi=10.1093/bja/aei229 |url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16143576 |accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref>  == Diving uses == {{Listen|right|filename=Helium article read with helium.ogg|title=Effect of helium on a human voice|description=The effect of helium on a human voice|format=[[Ogg]]}}  Owing to the expense of helium,<ref name=\"Fills\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fillexpress.com/fills.shtml#prices |title=Example pricing for filling cylinders |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> heliox is most likely to be used in deep [[commercial diving]].

Cartoons#1933-1944: Leon Schlesinger Productions|Leon Schlesinger Studios]], which later became the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] studio, during the [[Golden Age of American animation]]. He was also a distant relative of the Warner Brothers. As head of his own studio, Schlesinger served as the producer of Warner's ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoons from 1933, when Schlesinger assumed production from his subcontractors, [[Harman-Ising]], to 1944, when Warner acquired the studio.  ==Early life and career== Schlesinger was born in [[Philadelphia]]. After working at a theater as an usher, songbook agent, actor, and manager (including the [[Palace Theater (New York City)|Palace Theater]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]),<ref>''[[The Buffalo News]]'', April 15, 1944</ref> he founded [[Pacific Title & Art Studio]] in 1919, where most of his business was producing title cards for [[silent film]]s. As talking pictures (\"[[talkie]]s\")  replaced them in 1929 and 1930, Schlesinger looked for ways to capitalize on the new technology and stay in business. Some [[film historian]]s claim that he helped finance the Warner Brothers' first talkie, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927). He then secured a contract with the studio to produce its brand-new ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' series, and he signed [[animator]]s [[Hugh Harman]] and [[Rudy Ising]] to create these cartoons with their [[Bosko]] character as the star.  ==Schlesinger as businessman== Schlesinger was a shrewd businessman with a keen eye for talent. When Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. with Bosko in 1934, Schlesinger set up his own studio on the Warner Bros. [[Sunset Boulevard]] lot at the corner of Van Ness and Fernwood. He wooed animators away from other studios, including some of those who had departed with Harman and Ising including [[Bob Clampett]]. One of these was [[Friz Freleng]], whom Schlesinger promoted to oversee production of ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and to develop the sister series, ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''. Freleng's talent quickly shone through, and Schlesinger's hiring of [[Tex Avery]], [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Frank Tashlin]] further increased the quality of the studio's output. He later added [[Carl Stalling]] and [[Mel Blanc]], and collectively these men created such famous characters as [[Porky Pig]], [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Bugs Bunny]]. Schlesinger largely took a \"hands off\" approach to the animation unit, allowing his directors freedom to create what they wished, provided that the resulting films were successful. Schlesinger sold [[Pacific Title & Art Studio]] in 1935 to concentrate on his animation studio.  ===Business practices=== Schlesinger's hard-nosed business practices cannot be overstated. His animators worked in a dilapidated studio (Avery's unit were briefly assigned to a bungalow they dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]]\"), and Schlesinger briefly shut down the studio in mid-1941 when unionized employees demanded a pay raise. On another occasion, he boycotted the [[Academy Awards]] for what he claimed was preferential treatment for the [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Walt Disney]] and [[MGM cartoon studio]]s. He also farmed some of the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' out to his brother-in-law, Ray Katz, for tax breaks.  Schlesinger was also known (among his animators, at least) for his [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]. One oft-repeated \"official\" story states that [[Mel Blanc]] patterned the voices of both Daffy Duck and [[Sylvester the cat]] on Schlesinger. However, in Mel Blanc's autobiography, ''That's Not All Folks!'', he contradicts that conventional belief, writing \"It seemed to me that such an extended mandible would hinder his speech, particularly on words containing an ''s'' sound. Thus 'despicable' became 'des''th''picable'.\" Daffy's slobbery, exaggerated lisp was developed over time.  Animators who worked with Schlesinger also found him conceited and somewhat [[wikt:foppish|foppish]], wearing too much cologne and dressing like a dandy.  ==Appearances in shorts== Leon Schlesinger appeared as himself in Freleng's short ''[[You Ought to Be in Pictures]]'' (1940), one that combines live action with animation. In this short, Mel Blanc voices Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and all other characters, except Schlesinger who dubbed his voice because the studio did not have a sound camera. As with other Warner cartoon staffers, Schlesinger appeared in caricature form in such cartoons as ''[[Hollywood Steps Out]]'', ''[[Russian Rhapsody (film)|Russian Rhapsody]]'' and ''[[Nutty News]]''.  ==Later life and career== Schlesinger remained head of the animation studio until 1944 when he sold his assets to Warner Bros. He continued to market the characters and headed Warners' Theater Services unit<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=h_UDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA113&dq=%22leon+schlesinger%22#v=onepage&q=%22leon%20schlesinger%22&f=false | title = Billboard | author1 = Nielsen Business Media | first1 = Inc | date = February 7, 1948}}</ref> until his death from a viral infection on Christmas Day, 1949 at the age of 65. Schlesinger also produced a number of [[B-movie]] [[Western movie|Westerns]] in the 1930s. After Warner Bros. bought Schlesinger's studio, [[Eddie Selzer]] assumed Schlesinger's position as producer. Schlesinger was an avid racehorse fan and was a director of the Western Harness Racing Association. A United Press dispatch dated January 10, 1950, reported a director had been found to fill the vacancy caused by his death. He is interred in the Beth Olam Mausoleum inside the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in Hollywood, California.<ref>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=8776</ref>  ==References== {{Reflist}}  ==External links== {{Commons category}} *{{IMDb name|0772266}}  {{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}} {{Authority control}}  {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] --> |NAME= Schlesinger, Leon |ALTERNATIVE NAMES= |SHORT DESCRIPTION=Film producer |DATE OF BIRTH= May 20, 1884 |PLACE OF BIRTH= [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, US |DATE OF DEATH= December 25, 1949 |PLACE OF DEATH= Los Angeles }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Schlesinger, Leon}} [[Category:1884 births]] [[Category:1949 deaths]] [[Category:American film producers]] [[Category:American film studio executives]] [[Category:American people of German descent]] [[Category:American television producers]] [[Category:Burials at Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] [[Category:Businesspeople from Los Angeles, California]] [[Category:Businesspeople from New York]] [[Category:Businesspeople from Pennsylvania]] [[Category:People from Buffalo, New York|Schlesinger,Leon]]"],["It Can't Happen Here",201227,683116386,"2015-09-28T07:01:59.000+0000","SialhCascadia",26374402,"{{Other uses|Can't Happen Here (disambiguation)}} {{italic title}} {{Infobox book| <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books --> | name           = It Can't Happen Here | image          = File:ItCantHappenHere.jpg | caption        = First edition | author         = [[Sinclair Lewis]] | cover_artist   = | country        = [[United States]] | language       = [[English language|English]] | series         =  | genre          = [[Political fiction]] | publisher      = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran and Company]] | release_date   = 1935 | media_type     = Print ([[Hardcover]]) | pages          = 458 pp. | isbn           =  045121658X | preceded_by    =  | followed_by    =  }}  '''''It Can't Happen Here''''' is a semi-satirical 1935 [[political fiction|political novel]] by American author [[Sinclair Lewis]]. Published during the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe, the novel describes the rise of Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip, a populist [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] who is elected to the [[President of the United States|presidency]] after promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and traditional values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government and imposes a [[plutocratic]]/[[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. The novel's plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup's opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion. Reviewers at the time, and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the connection with Louisiana politician [[Huey Long]], who was preparing to run for president in the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 election]] when he was assassinated in 1935 just prior to the novel's publication.  ==Plot summary== In 1936 Senator Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip, a charismatic and power-hungry politician, wins the election as [[President of the United States]] on a [[populism|populist]] platform, promising to restore the country to prosperity and greatness, and promising each citizen $5,000 a year (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5000|1935|r=-4}}}}, [[adjusted for inflation]]{{inflation-fn|US}}). Portraying himself as a champion of traditional American values, Windrip easily defeats his opponents, Senator Walt Trowbridge and President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. Though having previously foreshadowed some [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] measures in order to reorganize the United States government, Windrip rapidly outlaws dissent, incarcerates political enemies in concentration camps, and trains and arms a [[paramilitary]] force called the Minute Men, who terrorize citizens and enforce the policies of Windrip and his \"corporatist\" regime. One of his first acts as president is to eliminate the influence of the [[United States Congress]], which draws the ire of many citizens as well as the legislators themselves. The Minute Men respond to protests against Windrip's decisions harshly, attacking demonstrators with bayonets. In addition to these actions, Windrip's administration, known as the \"Corpo\" government, curtails women's and minority rights, and eliminates individual states by subdividing the country into administrative sectors. The government of these sectors is managed by \"Corpo\" authorities, usually prominent businessmen or Minute Men officers. Those accused of crimes against the government appear before [[kangaroo court]]s presided over by \"military judges\".  Despite these dictatorial (and \"quasi-draconian\") measures, a majority of Americans approve of them, seeing them as necessary though painful steps to restore American power. Others, those less enthusiastic about the prospect of [[corporatism]], reassure themselves that fascism cannot \"happen here\"; hence the novel's title.  Open opponents of Windrip, led by Senator Trowbridge, form an organization called the New Underground, helping dissidents escape to Canada in manners reminiscent of the [[Underground Railroad]] and distributing anti-Windrip propaganda. One recruit to the New Underground is Doremus Jessup, the novel's protagonist, a traditional [[social liberalism|liberal]] and an opponent of both Corpoism and communist theories, which Windrip's administration suppresses. Jessup's participation in the organization results in the publication of a periodical called ''The Vermont Vigilance'', in which he writes editorials decrying Windrip's abuses of power. Shad Ledue, the local district commissioner and Jessup's former hired man, resents his old employer and eventually discovers his actions, having him sent to a concentration camp. Ledue subsequently terrorizes Jessup's family and particularly his daughter Sissy, whom he unsuccessfully attempts to seduce. Sissy does, however, discover evidence of corrupt dealings on the part of Ledue, which she exposes to Francis Tasbrough, a one-time friend of Jessup and Ledue's superior in the administrative hierarchy. Tasbrough has Ledue imprisoned in the same camp as Jessup, where inmates he had sent there organize his murder. Jessup escapes - after a relatively brief incarceration - when his friends bribe one of the camp guards. He flees to Canada, where he rejoins the New Underground. He later serves the organization as a spy in the northeastern United States, passing along information and urging locals to resist Windrip.  In time, Windrip's hold on power weakens as the economic prosperity he promised does not materialize and increased numbers of disillusioned Americans, including Vice President Perley Beecroft, flee to Canada or Mexico. He also angers his Secretary of State, Lee Sarason, who had served earlier as his chief political operative and adviser. Sarason and Windrip's other lieutenants, including General Dewey Haik, seize power and exile the president to France. Sarason succeeds Windrip, but his extravagant and relatively weak rule creates a power vacuum in which Haik and others vie for power. In a bloody putsch, Haik leads a party of military supporters into the White House, kills Sarason and his associates, and proclaims himself president. The two coups cause a slow erosion of Corpo power, and Haik's government desperately tries to arouse patriotism by launching an unjustified invasion of Mexico. After slandering Mexico in state-run newspapers, Haik orders a mass conscription of young American men for the invasion of that country, infuriating many who had until then been staunch Corpo loyalists. Riots and rebellions break out across the country, with many realizing that the Corpos have misled them.  General Emmanuel Coon, among Haik's senior officers, defects to the opposition with a large portion of his army, giving strength to the resistance movement. Though Haik remains in control of much of the country, civil war soon breaks out as the resistance tries to consolidate its grasp on the Midwest. The novel ends after the beginning of the conflict, with Jessup working as an agent for the New Underground in Corpo-occupied portions of southern Minnesota.  ==Reception== [[File:Sinclair Lewis It Can't Happen Here 1936 theater poster.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Poster for the stage adaptation of ''It Can't Happen Here'', October 27, 1936 at the Lafayette Theater as part of the [[Detroit]] [[Federal Theater Project|Federal Theater]]]] Reviewers at the time of the book's publication, and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the connection with Louisiana politician [[Huey Long]], who was preparing to run for president in 1936.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=62}} According to Boulard (1998), \"the most chilling and uncanny treatment of Huey by a writer came with Sinclair Lewis's ''It Can't Happen Here''.\"{{sfn|Boulard|1998|p=115}} Lewis portrayed a genuine American dictator on the Hitler model.

Lewis had the goal of hurting Long's chances in the 1936 election.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=62}} Keith Perry argues that the key weakness of the novel is not that he decks out American politicians with sinister European touches, but that he finally conceives of fascism and totalitarianism in terms of traditional American political models rather than seeing them as introducing a new kind of society and a new kind of regime.{{sfn|Perry|2004}} Windrip is less a Nazi than a con-man-plus-[[Rotary Club|Rotarian]], a manipulator who knows how to appeal to people's desperation, but neither he nor his followers are in the grip of the kind of world-transforming ideology like Hitler's [[National Socialism]].<ref>See also {{harvnb|Lingeman|2005|pp=400–408}}</ref>  ==Adaptations==  In 1936, Lewis and John C.

The script was presented to [[NBC]] for production as a television [[miniseries]], but NBC executives rejected the initial version, claiming it was too cerebral for the average American viewer. To make the script more marketable, the American fascists were re-cast as man-eating [[extraterrestrials]], taking the story into the realm of [[science fiction]].

The existence of this group was suggested by [[Bernd Fischer (mathematician)|Bernd Fischer]] in unpublished work from the early 1970s during his investigation of {3,4}-transposition groups: groups generated by a class of transpositions such that the product of any two elements has order at most 4.

This model is sometimes called the ''Standard Model'' of modern cosmology.<ref name=Goobar>{{citation |author=L. Bergström, A. Goobar |date=2006 |title=Cosmology and Particle Astrophysics |page=61 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CQYu_sutWAoC&pg=PA61 |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Sprint]] |isbn=3-540-32924-2}}</ref> It was developed independently by the named authors in the 1920s and 1930s.  == General metric ==  The FLRW metric starts with the assumption of [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. It also assumes that the spatial component of the metric can be time-dependent. The generic metric which meets these conditions is :<math>- c^2 \\mathrm{d}\\tau^2 = - c^2 \\mathrm{d}t^2 + {a(t)}^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2</math> where <math>\\mathbf{\\Sigma}</math> ranges over a 3-dimensional space of uniform curvature, that is, [[elliptical space]], [[Euclidean space]], or [[hyperbolic space]]. It is normally written as a function of three spatial coordinates, but there are several conventions for doing so, detailed below. <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}</math> does not depend on ''t'' — all of the time dependence is in the function ''a''(''t''), known as the \"[[Scale factor (universe)|scale factor]]\".  ===Reduced-circumference polar coordinates=== In reduced-circumference polar coordinates the spatial metric has the form :<math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Omega}^2, \\quad \\text{where } \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Omega}^2 = \\mathrm{d}\\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi^2.</math>  ''k'' is a constant representing the curvature of the space. There are two common unit conventions: *''k'' may be taken to have units of length<sup>−2</sup>, in which case ''r'' has units of length and ''a''(''t'') is unitless. ''k'' is then the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the space at the time when ''a''(''t'') = 1. ''r'' is sometimes called the reduced [[circumference]] because it is equal to the measured circumference of a circle (at that value of ''r''), centered at the origin, divided by 2{{pi}} (like the ''r'' of [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]). Where appropriate, ''a''(''t'') is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}</math> measures [[comoving distance]]. *Alternatively, ''k'' may be taken to belong to the set {−1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then ''r'' is unitless and ''a''(''t'') has units of length. When ''k'' = ±1, ''a''(''t'') is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the space, and may also be written ''R''(''t'').  A disadvantage of reduced circumference coordinates is that they cover only half of the 3-sphere in the case of positive curvature—circumferences beyond that point begin to decrease, leading to degeneracy. (This is not a problem if space is [[elliptical geometry|elliptical]], i.e. a 3-sphere with opposite points identified.)  ===Hyperspherical coordinates=== In ''hyperspherical'' or ''curvature-normalized'' coordinates the coordinate ''r'' is proportional to radial distance; this gives :<math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2 = \\mathrm{d}r^2 + S_k(r)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Omega}^2</math> where <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Omega}</math> is as before and :<math>S_k(r) = \\begin{cases} \\sqrt{k}^{\\,-1} \\sin (r \\sqrt{k}), &k > 0 \\\\ r, &k = 0 \\\\ \\sqrt{|k|}^{\\,-1} \\sinh (r \\sqrt{|k|}), &k < 0. \\end{cases} </math>  As before, there are two common unit conventions: *''k'' may be taken to have units of length<sup>−2</sup>, in which case ''r'' has units of length and ''a''(''t'' ) is unitless.  ''k'' is then the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the space at the time when ''a''(''t'' ) = 1.  Where appropriate, ''a''(''t'' ) is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}</math> measures [[comoving distance]]. *Alternatively, as before, ''k'' may be taken to belong to the set {−1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then ''r'' is unitless and ''a''(''t'' ) has units of length. When ''k'' = ±1, ''a''(''t'' ) is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the space, and may also be written ''R''(''t'' ).  Note that, when ''k'' = +1, ''r'' is essentially a third angle along with ''θ'' and ''φ''. The letter ''χ''  may be used instead of&nbsp;''r''.  Though it is usually defined piecewise as above, ''S'' is an [[analytic function]] of both ''k'' and ''r''. It can also be written as a [[power series]] :<math>S_k(r) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n k^n r^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = r - \\frac{k r^3}{6} + \\frac{k^2 r^5}{120} - \\cdots</math> or as :<math>S_k(r) = r \\; \\mathrm{sinc} \\, (r \\sqrt{k})</math> where sinc is the unnormalized [[sinc function]] and <math>\\sqrt{k}</math> is one of the imaginary, zero or real square roots of ''k''. These definitions are valid for all ''k''.  ===Cartesian coordinates=== When ''k'' = 0 one may write simply :<math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2 = \\mathrm{d}x^2 + \\mathrm{d}y^2 + \\mathrm{d}z^2.</math> This can be extended to ''k'' ≠ 0 by defining :<math> x = r \\cos \\theta \\,</math>, :<math> y = r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi \\,</math>, and :<math> z = r \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi \\,</math>, where ''r'' is one of the radial coordinates defined above, but this is rare.  == Solutions == {{General relativity sidebar |solutions}} {{main|Friedmann equations}}  Einstein's field equations are not used in deriving the general form for the metric: it follows from the geometric properties of homogeneity and isotropy. However, determining the time evolution of <math>a(t)</math> does require Einstein's field equations together with a way of calculating the density, <math>\\rho (t),</math> such as a [[equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equation of state]].  This metric has an analytic solution to [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]] <math>G_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\\mu\\nu}</math> giving the [[Friedmann equations]] when the [[energy-momentum tensor]] is similarly assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous. The resulting equations are:<ref>{{citation |author=P. Ojeda and H. Rosu |date=2006 |title=Supersymmetry of FRW barotropic cosmologies |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1191–1196 |doi=10.1007/s10773-006-9123-2 |arxiv=gr-qc/0510004 |bibcode=2006IJTP...45.1152R}}</ref> :<math>\\left(\\frac{\\dot a}{a}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{kc^{2}}{a^2} - \\frac{\\Lambda c^{2}}{3} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{3}\\rho</math> :<math>2\\frac{\\ddot a}{a} + \\left(\\frac{\\dot a}{a}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{kc^{2}}{a^2} - \\Lambda c^{2} = -\\frac{8\\pi G}{c^{2}} p.</math>  These equations are the basis of the standard [[big bang]] cosmological model including the current [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM]] model. Because the FLRW model assumes homogeneity, some popular accounts mistakenly assert that the big bang model cannot account for the observed lumpiness of the universe. In a strictly FLRW model, there are no clusters of galaxies, stars or people, since these are objects much denser than a typical part of the universe. Nonetheless, the FLRW model is used as a first approximation for the evolution of the real, lumpy universe because it is simple to calculate, and models which calculate the lumpiness in the universe are added onto the FLRW models as extensions. Most cosmologists agree that the [[observable universe]] is well approximated by an ''almost FLRW model'', i.e., a model which follows the FLRW metric apart from [[primordial fluctuations|primordial density fluctuations]]. {{As of|2003}}, the theoretical implications of the various extensions to the FLRW model appear to be well understood, and the goal is to make these consistent with observations from [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] and [[WMAP]].  ===Interpretation=== The pair of equations given above is equivalent to the following pair of equations :<math>{\\dot \\rho} = - 3 \\frac{\\dot a}{a}\\left(\\rho+\\frac{p}{c^{2}}\\right)</math> :<math>\\frac{\\ddot a}{a} = - \\frac{4\\pi G}{3}\\left(\\rho + \\frac{3p}{c^{2}}\\right) + \\frac{\\Lambda c^{2}}{3}</math> with <math>k</math>, the spatial curvature index, serving as a [[constant of integration]] for the first equation.  The first equation can be derived also from [[Thermodynamics of the universe|thermodynamical considerations]] and is equivalent to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], assuming the expansion of the universe is an [[adiabatic process]] (which is implicitly assumed in the derivation of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric).  The second equation states that both the energy density and the pressure cause the expansion rate of the universe <math>{\\dot a}</math> to decrease, i.e., both cause a deceleration in the expansion of the universe. This is a consequence of [[gravitation]], with pressure playing a similar role to that of energy (or mass) density, according to the principles of [[general relativity]]. The [[cosmological constant]], on the other hand, [[Dark energy|causes an acceleration in the expansion]] of the universe.  ===Cosmological constant=== The [[cosmological constant]] term can be omitted if we make the following replacements :<math>\\rho \\rightarrow \\rho + \\frac{\\Lambda c^{2}}{8 \\pi G}</math> :<math>p \\rightarrow p - \\frac{\\Lambda c^{4}}{8 \\pi G}.</math>  Therefore the [[cosmological constant]] can be interpreted as arising from a form of energy which has negative pressure, equal in magnitude to its (positive) energy density: :<math>p = - \\rho c^2. \\,</math> Such form of energy—a generalization of the notion of a [[cosmological constant]]—is known as [[dark energy]].  In fact, in order to get a term which causes an acceleration of the universe expansion, it is enough to have a [[scalar field theory|scalar field]] which satisfies :<math>p < - \\frac {\\rho c^2} {3}. \\,</math> Such a field is sometimes called [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]].  ===Newtonian interpretation=== The Friedmann equations are equivalent to this pair of equations: :<math> - a^3 {\\dot \\rho} = 3 a^2 {\\dot a} \\rho + \\frac{3 a^2 p {\\dot a}}{c^2} \\,</math> :<math>\\frac{{\\dot a}^2}{2} - \\frac{G \\frac{4 \\pi a^3}{3} \\rho}{a} = - \\frac{k c^2}{2} \\,.</math>  The first equation says that the decrease in the mass contained in a fixed cube (whose side is momentarily ''a'') is the amount which leaves through the sides due to the expansion of the universe plus the mass equivalent of the work done by pressure against the material being expelled. This is the conservation of mass-energy ([[first law of thermodynamics]]) contained within a part of the universe.  The second equation says that the kinetic energy (seen from the origin) of a particle of unit mass moving with the expansion plus its (negative) gravitational potential energy (relative to the mass contained in the sphere of matter closer to the origin) is equal to a constant related to the curvature of the universe. In other words, the energy (relative to the origin) of a co-moving particle in free-fall is conserved. General relativity merely adds a connection between the spatial curvature of the universe and the energy of such a particle: positive total energy implies negative curvature and negative total energy implies positive curvature.  The [[cosmological constant]] term is assumed to be treated as dark energy and thus merged into the density and pressure terms.  During the [[Planck epoch]], one cannot neglect [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects. So they may cause a deviation from the Friedmann equations.  == Name and history ==  The main results of the FLRW model were first derived by the Soviet mathematician [[Alexander Friedmann]] in 1922 and 1924. Although his work was published in the prestigious physics journal [[Zeitschrift für Physik]], it remained relatively unnoticed by his contemporaries. Friedmann was in direct communication with [[Albert Einstein]], who, on behalf of Zeitschrift für Physik, acted as the scientific referee of Friedmann's work. Eventually Einstein acknowledged the correctness of Friedmann's calculations, but failed to appreciate the physical significance of Friedmann's predictions.  Friedmann died in 1925. In 1927, [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian priest, astronomer and periodic professor of physics at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], arrived independently at similar results as Friedmann had and published them in Annals of the Scientific Society of Brussels. In the face of the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe obtained by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the late 1920s, Lemaître's results were noticed in particular by [[Arthur Eddington]], and in 1930–31 his paper was translated into English and published in the [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]].  [[Howard P. Robertson]] from the US and [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker]] from the UK explored the problem further during the 1930s. In 1935 Robertson and Walker rigorously proved that the FLRW metric is the only one on a spacetime that is spatially homogeneous and isotropic (as noted above, this is a geometric result and is not tied specifically to the equations of general relativity, which were always assumed by Friedmann and Lemaître).  Because the dynamics of the FLRW model were derived by Friedmann and Lemaître, the latter two names are often omitted by scientists outside the US. Conversely, US physicists often refer to it as simply \"Robertson–Walker\". The full four-name title is the most democratic and it is frequently used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Often the \"Robertson–Walker\" ''metric'', so-called since they proved its generic properties, is distinguished from the dynamical \"Friedmann-Lemaître\" ''models'', specific solutions for ''a''(''t'') which assume that the only contributions to stress-energy are cold matter (\"dust\"), radiation, and a cosmological constant.  == Einstein's radius of the universe ==  '''Einstein's radius of the Universe''' is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of space of [[Einstein's universe]], a long-abandoned [[Static spacetime|static]] model that was supposed to represent our universe in idealized form. Putting :<math>\\dot{a} = \\ddot{a} = 0</math>  in the Friedmann equation, the radius of curvature of space of this universe (Einstein's radius) is{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} :<math>R_E=c/\\sqrt {4\\pi G\\rho}</math>,  where <math>c</math> is the speed of light, <math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant|Newtonian gravitational constant]], and <math>\\rho</math> is the density of space of this universe. The numerical value of Einstein's radius is of the order of 10<sup>10</sup> [[light year]]s.  == Evidence ==  By combining the observation data from some experiments such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] with theoretical results of [[Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem]] and its generalization,<ref>See pp. 351ff. in {{citation |last1=Hawking |first1=Stephen W. |last2=Ellis |first2=George F.

The Earls were periodically subject to the kings of [[Norway]] for the [[Northern Isles]], and later also to the kings of [[Kingdom of Alba|Alba]] for those parts of their territory in mainland Scotland (i.e. Caithness and Sutherland). The Earl's status as a Norwegian [[vassal]] was formalised in 1195. In 1232, a Scottish dynasty descended from the [[Mormaers of Angus]] replaced the previous family descended from the [[Mormaer of Atholl|Mormaers of Atholl]], although it remained formally subject to Norway. This family was in turn replaced by the descendants of the [[Mormaer of Strathearn|Mormaers of Strathearn]] and later still by the [[Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Sinclair family]], during whose time Orkney passed to Scots control.  ==Norse Earls== [[Rognvald Eysteinsson]], [[Earl of Møre]] ''fl.'' 865–890{{#tag:ref|Assuming an identification of Rognvald with \"Ragnall son of Albdann\" in 865.<ref>Radnor (tr.)

Maol Íosa ruled Orkney and Caithness from 1331 to 1350. He left several daughters, but no sons. Orkney passed to his son-in-law, the Swedish councillor [[Erengisle Suneson, Earl of Orkney|Erengisle Suneson]]. Another son-in-law, Alexander de l'Ard, ruled as [[Earl of Caithness]] from 1350 until 1375, when the Earldom passed to the [[King of the Scots]].  In 1379, the Earldom of Orkney, without Caithness, was granted to another son-in-law of Maol Íosa, [[Henry Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Henry Sinclair]], by King [[Haakon VI of Norway|Haakon VI Magnusson]]. Earl Henry ruled until his death in 1401, and was succeeded by a son named Henry, who was followed by his son [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness|Earl William]], to whom the Earldom of Caithness was granted by the King of Scots in 1455. However, Orkney and Shetland were pledged to [[James III of Scotland|James III]] in place of a dowry for his bride [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]] by [[Christian I]]. James took the Earldom of Orkney for the Crown in 1470, and William was thereafter Earl of Caithness alone until he resigned the Earldom in favour of his son William in 1476, dying in 1484.  * [[Maol Íosa V, Earl of Strathearn|Maol Íosa]], (Strathearn 1330–1334; Caithness 1331–1334) 1331–1350 * [[Erengisle Suneson, Earl of Orkney|Erengisle Suneson]], (Orkney only) 1353–1357 * [[Earl of Caithness|Alexander de l'Ard]], (Caithness only) 1350–1375 * [[Henry Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Henry Sinclair]], (Orkney and Shetland) 1379–1401 * [[Henry II Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Henry Sinclair]], (Orkney and Shetland) 1401–? * [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness|William Sinclair]], (Orkney and Shetland 1434-1470; Caithness 1455–1476)  ==Scottish Earls== The next Orkney title was the [[Duke of Orkney|dukedom of Orkney]], which was given to [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], husband of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], in 1567. Later that year, however, he forfeited the title when his wife was forced to abdicate.  The second creation of the title was for [[Lord Robert Stewart]], an illegitimate son of [[James V of Scotland|King James V]]. His successor Patrick, however, forfeited the title.  The last creation of the earldom was in favour of the man who would become the first [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Field Marshal]], Lord [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|George Hamilton]], the fifth son of [[William Douglas, Duke of Hamilton]]. By marriage, the title passed to the O'Brien family, then to the Fitzmaurice family, and finally to the St John family. The present earl holds the subsidiary titles of ''[[Viscount of Kirkwall]]'' and ''[[Lord Dechmont]]''. Both subsidiary titles were created at the same time as the earldom, in 1696.  ===Dukes of Orkney (1567)=== * [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|James Hepburn, 1st Duke of Orkney]] (c. 1535–1578) (forfeit 1567)  ===Earls of Orkney, Second Creation (1581)=== * [[Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney]] (1533–1593) * [[Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney]] (c. 1569–1614) (forfeit 1614)  ===Earls of Orkney, Third Creation (1696)=== [[File:1stEarlOfOrkney.jpg|thumb|George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney (third creation)]] The third creation came in 1696 when the soldier [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Lord George Hamilton]] was made '''Lord Dechmont''', '''Viscount of Kirkwall''' and '''Earl of Orkney''' in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. Hamilton was the fifth son of [[William Douglas-Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton|William Douglas-Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton and 1st Earl of Selkirk]] and his wife [[Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton]]. The peerages were created with remainder to the heirs whatsoever of his body, which means that the titles can be passed on through both male and female lines. Lord Orkney was succeeded by his eldest daughter Anne, the second Countess. She married her first cousin [[William O'Brien, 4th Earl of Inchiquin]]. On her death the titles passed to her daughter, the third Countess. She married her second cousin [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Marquess of Thomond]] (the nephew of the fourth [[Earl of Inchiquin]]). She was succeeded by her daughter, the fourth Countess. She married the Hon. Thomas Fitzmaurice, second son of [[John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne]] and younger brother of Prime Minister [[William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne]]. On her death the titles passed to her grandson, [[John FitzMaurice, Viscount Kirkwall|Viscount Kirkwall]]'s son, the fifth Earl. He sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Representative peer|Scottish Representative Peer]] from 1833 to 1874.   His son, the sixth Earl, was a [[Representative peer|Scottish Representative Peer]] from 1885 to 1889. He was succeeded by his nephew, the seventh Earl. On his death the peerages passed to his first cousin twice removed, the eighth Earl. He was the great-grandson of the Hon. Frederick Fitzmaurice, third son of the fifth Earl. The succession was approved by the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] in 1955. He died childless and was succeeded by his third cousin, the ninth Earl. He is the son of Frederick Oliver St John, son of Isabella Annie Fitzmaurice, daughter of the Hon. James Terence Fitzmaurice, fifth son of the fifth Earl of Orkney. Lord Orkney lives in Canada and has been a professor at the [[University of Manitoba]]. His paternal grandfather [[Frederick Robert St John|Sir Frederick Robert St John]] was the youngest son of the Hon. Ferdinand St John, third son of [[George St John, 3rd Viscount Bolingbroke|George St John, 3rd Viscount Bolingbroke and 4th Viscount St John]]. Consequently, Lord Orkney is also in remainder to the viscounties of Bolingbroke and St John and their subsidiary titles.  * [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney]] (1666–1737) * [[Anne O'Brien, 2nd Countess of Orkney]] (d. 1756) * [[Mary O'Brien, 3rd Countess of Orkney]] (c. 1721–1791) * [[Mary FitzMaurice, 4th Countess of Orkney]] (1755–1831) * [[Thomas FitzMaurice, 5th Earl of Orkney|Thomas John Hamilton FitzMaurice, 5th Earl of Orkney]] (1803–1877) * [[George FitzMaurice, 6th Earl of Orkney|George William Hamilton FitzMaurice, 6th Earl of Orkney]] (1827–1889) * [[Edmond Walter FitzMaurice, 7th Earl of Orkney]] (1867–1951) * [[Cecil FitzMaurice, 8th Earl of Orkney|Cecil O'Bryen FitzMaurice, 8th Earl of Orkney]] (1919–1998) * [[Oliver Peter St John, 9th Earl of Orkney]] (b. 1938)  The [[heir apparent]] is the present holder's son Oliver Robert St John, Viscount Kirkwall (b. 1969).  {{hidden|Family tree|{{familytree/start}} {{familytree|GH| | | | | | | | | |GH='''[[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|George Hamilton,<br>1st Earl of Orkney]]'''<br>1666–1737}} {{familytree |!|}} {{familytree|AOB| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AOB='''[[Anne O'Brien, 2nd Countess of Orkney|Anne O'Brien,<br>2nd Countess of Orkney]]'''<br>d. 1756}} {{familytree |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}} {{familytree|MOB| | | | | | | | | |MOB='''[[Mary O'Brien, 3rd Countess of Orkney|Mary O'Brien,<br>3rd Countess of Orkney]]'''<br>1835}} {{familytree |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}} {{familytree|MM| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |MM='''[[Mary FitzMaurice, 4th Countess of Orkney|Mary FitzMaurice,<br>4th Countess of Orkney]]'''<br>1778–1820}} {{familytree |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}} {{familytree|MM| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |MM=[[John FitzMaurice, Viscount Kirkwall|John FitzMaurice,<br>Viscount Kirkwall]]<br>1755–1831}} {{familytree |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}} {{familytree|TF| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |TF='''[[Thomas FitzMaurice, 5th Earl of Orkney|Thomas FitzMaurice,<br>5th Earl of Orkney]]'''<br>1803–1877}} {{familytree |)|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}} {{familytree|GF| |HWF| |FOF| |JF| | | | | | | | |GF='''[[George FitzMaurice, 6th Earl of Orkney|George FitzMaurice,<br>6th Earl of Orkney]]'''<br>1827–1889|HWF=Hon.

The Act made it illegal to \"use [a house] or allow any person to make use of it to propagate [[Communism]] or [[Bolshevism]] by any means whatsoever\" as well as the printing, publishing or distributing of \"any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing, propagating Communism or Bolshevism.\" A violation of the Act subjected such property to being ordered closed by the Attorney General - \"padlocked\" - against any use whatsoever for a period of up to one year, and any person found guilty of involvement in prohibited media activities could be incarcerated for three to thirteen months.  [[File:News. Communistic Literature BAnQ P48S1P02676.jpg|thumb|left|Men reading confiscated literature in [[Montreal City Hall]], 1938]] The law was extremely vague; it did not define Communism or Bolshevism in any concrete way.  It denied both the [[presumption of innocence]] and [[freedom of speech]] to individuals. There were also concerns that the law would be used in order to arrest individual activists from international [[trade union]]s. Two union leaders were nearly arrested in that period.<ref>Rouillard, Jacques (1989). ''Le syndicalisme québécois : Deux siècles d'histoire.'' Montréal: Éditions Boréal, at page 68. ISBN 2-89052-243-1</ref> While it was applied frequently against a range of radical leftist groups, allegations that Duplessis used it against political opponents, including the left-wing [[United Jewish Peoples' Order]] in 1950, reports that it was used against the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are incorrect: the authorities typically used municipal by-laws, such as the one featured in [[Saumur v. The City of Quebec]].  The federal government under [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] could have used its power of [[disallowance and reservation|disallowance]] to nullify the Padlock Law, as it had done to overturn equally controversial laws that had been passed by [[Alberta]]'s [[Alberta Social Credit Party|Social Credit government]] around the same time.  However, King chose not to intervene in Quebec.  The most likely reason is that King did not want to alienate rural voters in Quebec, who continued to support the Liberals federally even as they supported the Union Nationale provincially.  In the 1957 decision of ''[[Switzman v. Elbling]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] struck down the law as unconstitutional because it not only violated the constitutional right to free speech, but because provincial governments did not have the power to legislate in the field of criminal law.  == References ==  <references/>  == External links == *[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/LoiduCadenas-PadlockLaw-MauriceDuplessis-QuebecHistory.htm Documents on the Padlock Law from Marianopolis College] *[http://www.historyofrights.com/events/padlock.html Canadian Rights Movement for the Padlock Act]  [[Category:Political history of Quebec]] [[Category:Quebec provincial legislation]] [[Category:Anti-communism]] [[Category:1937 establishments in Quebec]] [[Category:History of human rights in Canada]] [[Category:1937 in Canadian law]] [[Category:1957 disestablishments in Canada]] [[Category:Media legislation]] [[Category:Repealed Canadian legislation]] [[Category:Illegal speech]] [[Category:Real property law]] [[Category:Trade union legislation]] [[Category:Political law]]"],["1894 in architecture",595343,671225507,"2015-07-13T08:46:00.000+0000","Fayenatic london",1639942,"{{Year nav topic5|1894|architecture}}  The year '''1894 in architecture''' involved some significant events.  ==Events== * In the [[United States]], the [[Society of Beaux-Arts Architects]] is founded.  ==Buildings opened== [[File:Prudential Building HDR.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Louis Sullivan]]'s [[Prudential (Guaranty) Building|Guaranty Building]]]] *[[April 21]] - [[Quatro de Setembro Theater]], [[Teresina]], Brazil, opened. *[[May 14]] - [[Blackpool Tower]] in [[Blackpool]], [[England]], is completed to a design by [[Maxwell and Tuke]] and opened to the public. *[[June 30]] - [[Tower Bridge]] in [[London]], designed by [[Horace Jones (architect)]] and [[John Wolfe-Barry]], opened. *July - [[Dalen Hotel]] in [[Norway]], designed by [[Haldor Børve]].<ref>[http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Norway/Telemark/Dalen-221702/TravelGuide-Dalen.html Virtual Tourist: Dalen Travel Guide].

Hullshire may refer to the area outside the town of [[Kingston upon Hull]] within the county, whilst the entire entity was sometimes referred to as the \"Town and County of Hull\".  ==History== Hull was made a county town in 1440 in the reign of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. A  number of small towns nearby were separated from [[Yorkshire]] and added to it.{{sfn|Tickell|1798|pp=661–2}}{{sfn|Gent|1869|loc=Chap.VII pp.99–100 (p)}} The region was self-governing (a [[County corporate]]) in respect of it having its own courts, with powers of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'', to hold [[assizes]] on civil and criminal cases.{{sfn|Tickell|1798|p=685}} At creation the county had included into it the town and parishes of [[Hessle]] (Hassel), [[North Ferriby]], [[Swanland]], [[West Ella|West-Ella]], [[Kirk Ella|Kirk-Ella]], [[Tranby]]. Willardby ([[Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire|Willerby]]), [[Anlaby]] and the [[Haltemprice Priory|priory of Haltemprise]].{{sfn|Tickell|1798|p=93-95}} The rights previously given to the town of Hull were extended to the county, with the Mayor acting as the King's [[Escheat|Escheator]], and with the town [[Bailiff]]s replaced by [[Sheriff]] and twelve [[Aldermen]], acting as [[Justices of the Peace]] within the county, with the [[Burgess (title)|Burgess]]es to answer before the Mayor and Sheriff first, not the King. The Justices of the Peace of the East Riding had no legal authority in the county.{{sfn|Tickell|1798|pp=92–3, 96–8}} At the same time [[Hull Castle]] became the responsibility of the town.{{sfn|Gent|1869|loc=Chap.VII p.118 (ccc)}}  In 1515 a skirmish or battle was fought between the Sheriff of Hull and the Prior of [[Haltemprice Priory]] over the authority over [[Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire|Willerby]] (Willarby) and [[Wolfreton]] (Woolfreton) – the Prior claimed that though the priory was within the Shire of Hull it was not part of it, and was within the Lordship of [[Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire|Cottingham]], and had taken the issue to the [[Star Chamber]]; the case was referred to the Abbott of [[Meaux, East Riding of Yorkshire|Meaux]]; Bryan Palmes; and Sir [[William Constable]] who had decided in the Prior's favour. Despite this decision on 6 October the Sheriff of Hull together with 200 people of the town began to approach Wolfreton; the Prior, who had been informed of the Sheriff's intentions roused his tenants, and armed the monks of the Priory, who then blocked the roads, and hurled abuse on the Sheriff and his people. The Sheriff's party returned the insults in turn using foul language. Subsequently the altercation came to blows and a quarrel with arrows ensued. The battle continued until the monks, many being old or fat, gave way, and fled to their priory, followed by the Sheriff's group. The situation was prevented from becoming more inflamed by the arrival of the Lord Mayor of Hull, who having learned of what was happening hastened to the scene with 60 horsemen. Subsequently the Prior sort redress in the Star Chamber, with the Sheriff accuseed of riot and other crimes – the legal proceedings continued for three years at much expense, leading to the settlement that the Prior was given Willerby and Newton within his authority, whilst Hull obtained free right to the fresh water springs of Anlaby.{{sfn|Tickell|1798|pp=141–3}}  [[Sculcoates]], [[Drypool]], the southern part of Sutton ([[Sutton-on-Hull]]), [[Garrison Side]] as well as the liberties of [[Myton, Hull|Myton]] and [[Trippett]] were added to the parliamentary borough in 1832, and in 1836 the new municipal borough was made to be of the same extent.

She is a [[catgirl]] who first appeared in the 1994 game ''[[Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors]]'' and its subsequent sequels, later appearing in other Capcom games outside of the ''Darkstalkers'' series and related media and merchandise.  ==Conception and design== [[File:Felicia concept arts.png|thumb|left|300px|Concept arts of Felicia, as seen in the art book ''Darkstalkers: Official Complete Works'']]  The character was originally envisioned by [[Capcom]] producer and ''Darkstalkers'' original creator Alex Jimenez as a beautiful long-legged African vampiress.<ref name=gt/> Early in the development of ''Darkstalkers'', the team decided to have two female characters: a [[catgirl]] and a [[vampiress]], characters who would eventually become Felicia and [[Morrigan Aensland|Morrigan]], respectively. Initially, Morrigan was to be the \"cute\" female character of the title, while Felicia would be the \"sexy\" female character. However, as Morrigan's character developed into that of a [[succubus]] she was made to be far more sexually appealing, and the roles of the two characters were reversed.  Felicia is a cute-faced, curvaceous \"[[bakeneko]]\". As such, she has cat ears, pointed teeth, a tail, and oversized hands and feet that resemble a cat's paws, complete with sharp claws that she uses in battle. She also has a heavy mane of long blue hair, blue eyes, and an \"outfit\" that consists entirely of thin strips of skimpy white fur. The fur leaves her technically nude except for that which partially covers her breasts, portions of her stomach and hips, and forms panty-like bottoms, as well as covering her arms and legs. [[Felicia|Her name]] is adapted from [[Latin language|Latin]] [[Felicity (given name)|Felicity]] (\"happy\" or \"happiness\").  [[Gameplay]]-wise, Felicia is similar to ''[[Street Fighter]]'''s [[Chun-Li]] but with some major differences. She uses quick nimble attacks and has particularly long [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]].<ref>''Official Sega Saturn Magazine'' 9, page 84.</ref> {{clear left}}  ==Appearances== ===In video games=== Felicia is a catwoman who was taken in and raised by a [[Catholic]] nun named Rose. When Rose died, Felicia left her town hoping to become a music star. She knew that the outside world was not pretty as it was filled with much prejudice towards darkstalkers for being different. Despite this, Felicia never lost hope, as she remembered what she was told before that one has to obtain happiness on their own. She wishes there to be a way for peaceful coexistence between darkstalkers and humans alike. For that, she pursues her dream of becoming a star to serve as a bridge between them. During her travels, she met many other catgirls of her kind. With her new found catgirl friends (Alto, Grace, Lucy, Nana & Mimi, Nonno, and Piko), she set out for her dream of being on stage.  Besides the ''Darkstalkers'' series, Felicia appears as a [[player character|playable character]] in several other video games, including ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]'',  ''[[Cross Edge]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', ''[[Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix|Pocket Fighter]]'', ''[[Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo|Puzzle Fighter]]'', ''[[Project X Zone 2]]'', ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium]]'', ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash]]'', ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3]]'' and ''[[Onimusha]] Soul'' (redesign to fit it [[feudal Japan]] theme<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.oni-soul.jp/contents/collabo/index_m.html#collabo|title=鬼武者Soul CAPCOMタイトルコラボ|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>). In the crossover tactical role-playing game ''[[Namco × Capcom]]'', Felicia teams up with [[King (Tekken)|King II]] from ''[[Tekken]]'' to make the only two-character team in the game to include both a [[Namco]] character and a Capcom character. She is set to appear in ''[[Project X Zone 2]]'' as an ally support unit. <ref>http://www.destructoid.com/meow-felicia-confirmed-for-project-x-zone-2-294402.phtml</ref>  ===Other appearances=== The anime OAV ''[[Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge (anime)|Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge]]'' (1997), Felicia is shown as already having a certain amount of success as an entertainer and is just starting a tour in the human world with her own traveling show. However, her tour gets off to a rough start when she is almost killed by monks pertaining to an anti-darkstalker militia and the zombie [[Lord Raptor]] saves her by promptly killing them all. Later, as [[Pyron]] begins his bid for world domination, Felicia attacks his Huitzil robot army. She destroys a few of the robots before being overwhelmed, but she is saved when the werewolf [[Jon Talbain]] intervenes. She is taken in by a human doctor and befriends the local children, only to be captured by a human paramilitary group. The doctor rescues her and with her faith in humanity renewed she, along with Talbain, lures the robots out of the town and destroying them with an explosives laden train. A major difference between this Felicia and the game's Felicia is that there is no mention of her origin and her religiosity is reversed: while it can be assumed from her being raised by a nun that the game Felicia is Catholic, her anime counterpart informs Raptor she is ambivalent to organized religion.  Felicia is the main hero in the American cartoon series ''[[Darkstalkers (TV series)|Darkstalkers]]'' (1995), in which she was accompanied by Harry Grimoire, a character created for this particular series whose purpose (aside from a plot device) was mainly to get Felicia into trouble. She is also stated to be several hundred years old in this. Her dreams of being a singer are never mentioned (although in the first episode she was fired from ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' because her \"costume\" was \"out of date\"). Felicia was also depicted as possibly being the last of her kind, despite having other catgirl friends in the game series itself.  In the [[UDON|UDON Comics]] version of ''Darkstalkers'', Felicia is still looking for her big break into stardom; unfortunately being a catgirl proves to be a very large roadblock on the path to fame. Along the way, she runs into Talbain who believes that humans are treacherous and vile, while she thinks that the current hatred between humans and darkstalkers are just a few \"bumps in the road.\" Despite the fact that his interference costs her a potential gig, Felicia asks Talbain to accompany her, so that she can try to prove to him that humanity is not all bad. Eventually, they end up at the Catholic orphanage where Felicia grew up; her foster mother is named Sister Cecillia and is still alive and active in her foster daughter's life.  Several figurines of Felicia have been made since her introduction, ranging from immobile figurines by companies such as [[Kaiyodo]], [[Volks]], Yujin, Clayz, Kotobukiya, and MIT Japan, to a posable action figure by Medicom Toy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Darkstalkers Graphic File |last=Udon Staff |year=2008 |publisher=Udon Entertainment |isbn=1-897376-04-9 |pages=136–137}}</ref> She is also a character card in the collectible card game ''[[Universal Fighting System]]''. In the [[shōnen]] manga series ''[[Love Hina]]'', a few of the main female characters appear in the costumes of B.B. Hood, Hsien-Ko, and Felicia—though much less revealing—for Halloween in chapter 86 of the manga. In the [[Cartoon Network]] animated series ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'' (2011), Felicia makes cameo in the season one segment \"Gaming's Next Top Princess\". {{-}}  ==Reception and cultural impact== [[File:Darkstalkers FanimeCon 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cosplay]]ers of Felicia and [[Q-Bee]] at [[FanimeCon]] 2014.

This event was much publicized, as Amirouche was considered a great threat to the French in Algeria.<ref>[http://www.intercultures.ca/cil-cai/intercultural_issues_print-en.asp?lvl=8&ISO=dz ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>  Secularist politician [[Nordine Ait Hamouda]] is his son.  ==See also== *[[French rule in Algeria]] *[[History of Algeria]] *[[Provinces of Algeria]]  ==Notes and references== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *[http://www.highbeam.com/library/docfree.asp?DOCID=1G1:135843314&ctrlInfo=Round19%3AMode19b%3ADocG%3AResult&ao= War in Algeria: the French experience]  {{Persondata | NAME              = Amirouche, Colonel | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = Algerian War leader | DATE OF BIRTH     = 1926 | PLACE OF BIRTH    = Tassaft Ouguemoun, [[Iboudraren]], [[Algeria]] | DATE OF DEATH     = 1959 | PLACE OF DEATH    = south of [[Bou Saâda]], [[Algeria]] }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Amirouche, Colonel}} [[Category:1926 births]] [[Category:1959 deaths]] [[Category:People from Iboudraren]] [[Category:Kabyle people]] [[Category:Movement for the Triumph of Democratic Liberties politicians]] [[Category:Members of the National Liberation Front (Algeria)]] [[Category:People of the Algerian War]] [[Category:Algerian guerrillas killed in action]]  {{Algeria-mil-bio-stub}}"],["Ferocactus",1587990,662688407,"2015-05-17T01:22:48.000+0000","KasparBot",24420788,"{{italic title}} {{taxobox |name = ''Ferocactus'' |image = Ferocactus glaucescens Prg1.jpg |image_caption = ''[[Ferocactus glaucescens]]'' |regnum = [[Plant]]ae |unranked_divisio = [[Flowering plant|Angiosperms]] |unranked_classis = [[Eudicots]] |unranked_ordo = [[Core eudicots]] |ordo = [[Caryophyllales]] |familia = [[Cactus|Cactaceae]] |subfamilia = [[Cactoideae]] |tribus = [[Cacteae]] |genus = '''''Ferocactus''''' |genus_authority = [[Nathaniel Lord Britton|Britton]] & [[Joseph Nelson Rose|Rose]]<ref name=\"GRIN\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/genus.pl?4651 |title=Genus: ''Ferocactus'' Britton & Rose  |work=Germplasm Resources Information Network |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |date=2004-02-13 |accessdate=2010-11-14}}</ref> |subdivision_ranks = [[Species]] |subdivision = See text. |synonyms = ''Bisnaga'' <small>[[Charles Russell Orcutt|Orcutt]]</small><br> ''Brittonia'' <small>[[C.A.Armstr.]]</small><ref name=\"GRIN\"/> |}}  [[File:Ferocactus cylindraceus 12.jpg|thumb|''[[Ferocactus cylindraceus]]'', [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area]], Nevada, USA]] [[File:Ferocactus-echidne01.jpg|thumb|''[[Ferocactus echidne]]'']] '''''Ferocactus''''' is a genus of large [[Barrel cactus|barrel-shaped]] [[Cactus|cacti]], mostly with large spines and small flowers. There are about 30 species included in the genus. They are found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.   ==Description== The young specimens are columnar but as they grow older ribs form and they take on a barrel form. Most of the species are solitary but some, such as ''[[Ferocactus robustus]]'' and ''[[Ferocactus glaucescens|F. glaucescens]]'', form clumps. The flowers are pink, yellow, red or purple depending on the species, and the petals sometimes have a stripe of a darker colour.  ==Habitat== They are [[desert]] dwellers and can cope with some frost and intense heat. The typical habitat is hot and very arid, and the plants have adapted to exploit water movement to concentrate their biomass in areas where water is likely to be present. Like ''[[Sclerocactus]]'', ''Ferocactus'' typically grow in areas where water flows irregularly or depressions where water can accumulate for short periods of time. They are most often found growing along [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] (washes) where their seeds have been subjected to [[Scarification (botany)|scarfication]] due to water movement, but they oddly also tend to grow along ridges in spots where depressions have formed and can hold water for some period of time.  ==Adaptations== ''Ferocactus'' have very shallow root systems and are easily uprooted during flash floods. The \"fishhook\" spines and the armored web of spines enclosing the cactus body in many species of this genus are adaptations which allow the plant to move to more favorable locations. The seeds germinate in areas where water movement occurs or in areas where standing water accumulates for some period of time, and during [[flash flood]]s, the hooked spines allow the plants to be caught on waterborne debris, uprooted and carried to areas where water tends to accumulate.  ==Cultivation== In cultivation ferocactus require full sun, little water, and good drainage. They are popular as [[houseplants]].  They cannot tolerate freezing temperatures for extended periods, which typically cause them to yellow, bleach, then slowly die. [[plant propagation|Propagation]] is usually from seeds.  ==Ecology== Many ferocactus species are [[ant plant]]s, exuding nectar along the upper meristem from extrafloral nectaries above each areole, and hosting ant colonies.  ==Selected species== [[File:Ferocactusrobustus.jpg|thumb|''Ferocactus robustus'', [[Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve]], Mexico]] [[File:Ferocactus wislizeni338980330.jpg|thumb|''Ferocactus wislizeni'' in bloom]] * ''[[Ferocactus alamosanus]]'' * ''[[Ferocactus chrysacanthus]]'' * ''[[Ferocactus cylindraceus]]'' <small>(Engelm.)

He also wrote the final episode of the [[Beast Wars]]: Transformers cartoon, the Transformers Ultimate Fan Guide, and several convention exclusive comics and novellas.  His first published work appeared in 1984 in Fleetway's weekly comic, ''[[Scream! (comics)|Scream!]]'' issue 3, writing the opening episode of \"Terror of the Cats\". He currently writes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Transformers for Titan Magazines in the UK and the US Transformers comic line published by IDW.  He has also used the pseudonym '''Chris Francis''' on occasion, most notable when editing Marvel UK's ''Transformers'' to keep his role separate from writing some of the stories.  ==Career== Furman invented an origin story for the ''Transformers'' that involved an ancient struggle between the colossal godlike creator, [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]], and his counterpart, the colossal godlike destroyer, [[Unicron]]. The latter was borrowed from the ''Transformers'' movie, where he appeared with no given backstory (a conflicting origin for Unicron later came in the third season of the original Transformers cartoon series). According to Furman's origin story, The Transformers were a creation of Primus as a warrior race who were to be the last line of defence against Unicron. This origin differs from the third season of the cartoon series, where the Transformers were originally created to be robot servants of the alien [[Quintesson]]s, who often sold them to other races.  Aside from the creation myth, mythological underpinnings can be found in several of his stories such as the [[Matrix Quest]] storyline, where the [[Autobot]]s and [[Decepticon]]s search for the [[Creation Matrix]], a powerful object constructed by Primus.  Furman's ''Transformers: Generation 2'' plot-line in 1993 introduced the characters Jhiaxus and [[Liege Maximo]], one of the first Transformers. Liege Maximo had killed the first Prime to steal the Matrix and claimed that the Decepticons descended from him. Since Transformers Generation 2 was cancelled after 12 issues, the Liege Maximo storyline was concluded in the convention exclusive novella ''Alignment''.  Over ten years later, Furman was brought in by the now-defunct independent comics publisher [[Dreamwave]] to write some of its Transformers comics, including \"[[Transformers: The War Within|The War Within]]\", a six issue prequel set on Cybertron before the Autobots and Decepticons took their battle to Earth. It spawned two sequels – \"TWW: The Dark Ages\" and \"TWW: The Age Of Wrath\" (uncompleted). His work on the Armada and Energon titles were also received better than the anime series from which they were based on. Furman was to have continued on with Dreamwave, but its contentious closure resulted in the premature end of the Energon and The War Within titles.  Furman's convention exclusive novella/comic serial, ''The Omega Point'', includes an apocalyptic End of Days scenario for the Transformers, and a quest by one of the heroes to ask for help in the land of the dead.  Simon Furman still collaborates with regular Marvel UK Transformers artist, [[Andrew Wildman]], as WildFur Productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildfur.net/ |title=wildfur productions |publisher=Wildfur.net |date= |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref> Their most recent collaboration was on the [[Macromedia Flash]] online, interactive comic ''The Engine: Industrial Strength'', which they produced with UK New Media expert [[Adam Jennings]].  Away from Transformers, Furman wrote a Doctor Who audio adventure for [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]. ''[[The Axis of Insanity]]'' features the Fifth Doctor, and was published in 2004. He also contributed a number of stories starring [[Judge Dredd]] to the [[DC Comics|DC]] title ''Judge Dredd: Lawman of the Future'', as well as one-off stories to Dredd's home title ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]''.

The station is located on the DLR's [[Stratford station|Stratford branch]], between [[Devons Road DLR station|Devons Road]] and [[Pudding Mill Lane DLR station|Pudding Mill Lane]] stations and is in [[Travelcard Zone 2]]. It is within 300 m walking distance of [[Bow Road tube station|Bow Road station]] on [[London Underground]]'s [[District line|District]] and [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith and City]] lines. Through ticketing is allowed between both stations. The DLR station opened with the original system on 31 August 1987. The station takes its name from the nearby 14th century [[Bow Church]], which is an [[Church of England|Anglican]] church.  There is a crossover south of the station which allows trains from Stratford and Poplar to reverse here. One example of this is when the new platforms at Stratford were being constructed - trains were suspended between Bow Church and Stratford and trains from Poplar terminated here.  ==Connections== [[London Buses]] routes [[London Buses route 25|25]], [[London Buses route 205|205]], [[London Buses route 425|425]] and [[London Buses route D8|D8]], night route [[List of night buses in London#N205|N205]] and [[National Express Coaches]] route [[National Express Coaches#routes|A9]] serve the station.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== {{commons category}} * [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gettingaround/transportaccessibility/dlr/3268.aspx Docklands Light Railway website - Bow Church station page]  {{s-rail-start}} {{s-rail|title=DLR}} {{s-line|system=DLR|line=DLR|previous=Devons Road|next=Pudding Mill Lane|type=Lewisham|type2=Stratford}} {{end}}  {{Docklands Light Railway}}  <!--Categories--> [[Category:Docklands Light Railway stations in Tower Hamlets]] [[Category:Railway stations opened in 1987]] [[Category:Bow, London]]   {{London-dlr-stub}} {{London-railstation-stub}}"],["The Globe Sessions",1128231,674099693,"2015-08-01T17:01:58.000+0000","DavidRavenMoon",1296476,"{{Infobox album <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --> |Name=The Globe Sessions |Type=studio |Artist=[[Sheryl Crow]] |Cover=Sheryl_Crow,_The_Globe_Sessions.png |Released={{Start date|1998|9|21}} <small>([[United Kingdom|UK]])</small><br /> {{Start date|1998|9|29}} <small>([[United States|US]])</small> |Recorded=Globe Studios, [[New York City|New York, NY]] and [[Sound Factory|Sunset Sound Factory]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles, CA]], 1996-98 |Genre=[[Rock music|Rock]], [[blues rock]], [[country rock]] |Length=55:06 |Label=[[A&M Records|A&M]] |Producer=[[Sheryl Crow]] <br> [[Rick Rubin]] <small>(\"Sweet Child o' Mine\")</small> |Last album=''[[Sheryl Crow (album)|Sheryl Crow]]''<br />(1996) |This album='''''The Globe Sessions'''''<br />(1998) |Next album=''[[Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live from Central Park]]''<br />(1999) | Misc                = {{Singles   | Name            = The Globe Sessions   | Type              = studio   | single 1         = [[My Favorite Mistake]]   | single 1 date = September 15, 1998   | single 2         = [[There Goes the Neighborhood (Sheryl Crow song)|There Goes the Neighborhood]]   | single 2 date = 1999   | single 3         = [[Anything but Down]]   | single 3 date = February 23, 1999   }} }} {{Album ratings | rev1 = [[Allmusic]] | rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r373479|tab=review|label=\"Sheryl Crow: ''The Globe Sessions'' > Review\" |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> | rev2 = Daily Vault | rev2Score = (B)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=518 |title=''The Globe Sessions'': Sheryl Crow |first=Sean |last=McCarthy |date={{date|10/26/1998}} |publisher=DailyVault.com |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> | rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | rev3Score = A−<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285184,00.html |title=''The Globe Sessions'' (1998): Sheryl Crow, Joni Mitchell |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date={{date|Oct 09, 1998}} |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue=#453 |publisher=Time |issn=1049-0434 |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> | rev4 = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | rev4Score = {{rating|4|4}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/27/entertainment/ca-26892 |title=Sheryl Crow 'The Globe Sessions' |date= {{date|September 27, 1998}} |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=Tribune Company |issn=0458-3035 |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> | rev5 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' | rev5Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/301552/sherylcrow?pageid=rs.ArtistDiscography&pageregion=triple1 |title=''Sheryl Crow'': The Globe Sessions |first=James |last=Hunter |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=RS 797 |publisher=Straight Arrow |issn=0035-791X |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050326222828/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/301552/sherylcrow?pageid=rs.ArtistDiscography&pageregion=triple1 |archivedate={{date|2005-03-26}}}}</ref> | rev6 = [[Robert Christgau]] | rev6Score = {{Rating-Christgau|hm1}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1242 |title=Sheryl Crow |first=Robert |last=Christgau |publisher=RobertChristgau.com |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> }}  '''''The Globe Sessions''''' is the third studio [[album]] by [[United States|American]] [[singer/songwriter]] [[Sheryl Crow]], released on 21 September 1998 in the [[United Kingdom]] and 29 September 1998 in the [[United States]], then re-released in 1999.

Together with two Swedish members of the nobility he undertook a travel through Europe in 1651-1656. On returning he was ordained priest and later vicar. In 1663 he was appointed vicar in his home town Ljungby where he was very comfortable.   He was appointed court chaplain in 1668 and gave the King [[Eucharist|communion]] in 1670. He was also entrusted with commissioning the new Bible translation and revising the Swedish book of hymns.   He published many works.

Encyclopedia.com. 6 Dec. 2012.</ref>  ==Use== Modern [[iterative method]]s for finding one (or a few) eigenvalues of large [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]] or solving large systems of linear equations avoid matrix-matrix operations, but rather multiply vectors by the matrix and work with the resulting vectors. Starting with a vector, ''b'', one computes <math>A b</math>, then one multiplies that vector by <math>A</math> to find <math>A^2 b</math> and so on.  All algorithms that work this way are referred to as Krylov subspace methods; they are among the most successful methods currently available in numerical linear algebra.    ==Issues== Because the vectors usually soon become almost [[linear independence|linearly dependent]] due to the properties of [[power iteration]], methods relying on Krylov subspace frequently involve some [[orthogonalization]] scheme, such as [[Lanczos iteration]] for [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] or [[Arnoldi iteration]] for more general matrices.  ==Existing methods== The best known Krylov subspace methods are the [[Arnoldi iteration|Arnoldi]], [[Lanczos iteration|Lanczos]], [[Conjugate gradient]], [[IDR(s)]] (Induced dimension reduction), [[GMRES]] (generalized minimum residual), [[BiCGSTAB]] (biconjugate gradient stabilized), [[quasi minimal residual|QMR]] (quasi minimal residual), [[TFQMR]] (transpose-free QMR), and [[MINRES]] (minimal residual) methods.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==Bibliography== * '''Key reference paper''': A N Krylov.

By the 1960s, freeway access was needed between Chicopee and Holyoke to improve traffic flow which prompted a spur route of Interstate 91 to be built. I-391's planned six lanes were built to handle up to 50,000 vehicles every day, and the total cost of the proposed highway was estimated at about $35 million. In 1965, an alignment of the highway had been set, along with two alternative alignments. Construction for Interstate 391 began in 1967 with a short {{convert|0.75|mi|km|abbr=on}} long highway, which was completed in 1970. After years of no progress, construction started again in 1978. The highway was completed in 1982 after about 15 years of planning and construction.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bostonroads.com|title=Interstate 391 (Massachusetts)|year=|publisher=|accessdate=2008-05-26|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-391_MA/}}</ref>  [[File:I-391 near MA-141.jpg|thumb|right|Just before the Route 141 interchange]]  ==Exit list== {{jcttop|exit|state=MA|county=Hampden|length_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\">{{cite web|url=http://services.massdot.state.ma.us/mrla/RouteSelection.htm|title=Massachusetts Route Log Application|author=MassDOT Planning Division|date=|website=|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref>|location_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\" />}} {{MAint|exit |location=Chicopee |lspan=5 |mile=0.065 |exit=1A |road={{jct|state=MA|I|91|dir1=south|city1=Springfield|location2=[[Hartford, CT]]}} |notes=}} {{MAint|exit |mile=0.626 |exit=1B |road={{jct|state=MA|I|91|dir1=north|city1=Greenfield}} |notes=}} {{MAint|exit |mile=0.952 |exit=2 |road={{jct|state=MA|MA|116|location1=Chicopee Center}} |notes=To [[Elms College]]}} {{MAint|exit |mile=1.900 |exit=3 |road={{jct|state=MA|MA|116|location1=[[Westover Air Reserve Base|Westover ARB]]|city2=Willimansett}} |notes=}} {{MAint|exit |mile=3.860 |exit=4 |type=concur |road={{jct|state=MA|MA|141|dir1=south|city1=Chicopee Falls|city2=Willimansett}} |notes=South end of overlap with Route 141; split into exits 4A (east) and 4B (west) southbound}} {{jctbridge|exit |location_special=[[Connecticut River]] |mile=4.509 |bridge=Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge}} {{MAint|exit |location=Holyoke |lspan=3 |mile=4.593 |exit=5 |type=concur |road={{jct|state=MA|MA|141|dir1=north|name1=Main Street}} |notes=North end of overlap with Route 141; northbound exit and southbound entrance}} {{MAint|exit |mile=4.940 |exit=6 |road=Commercial Street |notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance}} {{MAint|exit |mile=5.160 |exit=&ndash; |road=High Street |notes=At-grade intersection; northern terminus}} {{jctbtm|keys=incomplete,concur}}  ==References== {{Reflist}}  ==External links== {{AttachedKML|display=title,inline}} * [http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-391_MA/ I-391 Historical Overview from bostonroads.com]  {{3di|91}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Interstate 91-3}} [[Category:Auxiliary Interstate Highways|91-3]] [[Category:Interstate Highways in Massachusetts|91-3]] [[Category:Interstate 91|3]] [[Category:Transportation in Hampden County, Massachusetts]]"],["Bagrat VI of Georgia",3010702,651980907,"2015-03-18T21:03:41.000+0000","Cplakidas",613068,"'''Bagrat VI''' ({{lang-ka|ბაგრატ VI}}) ({{circa}} 1439 – 1478), a representative of the [[Imereti]]an branch of the [[Bagrationi]] royal house, was a [[Kingdom of Imereti|king of Imereti]] (as '''Bagrat II''') from 1463, and a [[List of the Kings of Georgia|king]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] from 1465 until his death.  ==Life== He was the son of Prince [[George, son of Constantine I of Georgia|George]]. Around 1455, he was granted the title of [[Eristavi]] (duke) of [[Samokalako]] ([[Kutaisi]], western Georgia, and the surroundings) by the Georgian king [[George VIII of Georgia|George VIII]]. In the early 1460s, Bagrat supported the rebel prince [[Qvarqvare I Jakeli]], [[atabeg]] of [[Samtskhe]], and the king took Bagrat's duchy away. In 1463, Bagrat led a coalition of western Georgian nobles who met and defeated George VIII at the [[Battle of Chikhori]]. Subsequently, Bagrat captured Kutaisi and was crowned king of [[Imereti]]. But in return for their aid, the new monarch was obliged to create a principality ('''''samtavro''''') for each of his four allies. Henceforth the [[Gelovani]] clan in [[Principality of Svaneti|Svaneti]], the [[Shervashidze]] (Sharvashidze) in [[Principality of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]], the [[Dadiani]] in [[Odishi]] (Mingrelia), and the [[House of Vardanisdze|Vardanidze]] in [[Principality of Guria|Guria]] ruled as semi-independent princes.  In 1465, after the king George VIII was defeated and imprisoned by Qvarqvare of Samtskhe, Bagrat used the opportunity to seize control of [[Tbilisi]]. Crowned king of Georgia, he ruled both [[Imereti]] in the west and [[Kingdom of Kartli (1484-1762)|Kartli]] in the east, but remained mostly in western Georgia. In his western possessions, he also established a separate church, [[Catholicosate of Abkhazia]], independent from the Patriarchate of [[Mtskheta]] (i.e., [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]). To justify this step, he asked [[Michael IV of Antioch|Michael IV]], [[List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch]] of [[Antioch]] and [[Jerusalem]], to compose a \"Law of Faith\" which stated that western and eastern Georgia had different history of conversion and, therefore, they should be independent from each other.  Once freed from captivity, George VIII attempted to recover his throne, but was only able to secure the eastern Georgian province [[Kakheti]], leaving the field in Kartli to his nephew, [[Constantine II of Georgia|Constantine]] who seems to have established himself as a virtual ruler in part of Kartli in 1469. During this time of triarchy, Georgia was at least twice [[Turkoman invasions of Georgia|attacked]] by [[Uzun Hasan]], the prince of the [[Ak Koyunlu]] clan ([[Münejjim Bashi]] speaks of three invasions, in 1466, in summer of 1472, and after Uzun Hassan's defeat by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1476-7).<ref>[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] [http://www1.encislam.brill.nl/data/EncIslam/S8/SIM-7788.html article] on [[Uzun Hasan]]</ref> Bagrat had to make peace with the invaders, abandoning Tbilisi to the enemy. It was only after Uzun Hasan's death (1478) when the Georgians were able to recover their capital.  Bagrat died in 1478, and was succeeded by his son, [[Alexander II of Georgia|Alexander II]].  Bagrat VI was buried at the [[Gelati Monastery]] near [[Kutaisi]].  ==Family and children== He was married to Elene (died November 3, 1510), who bore him three sons: *Vakhtang (died very young) *[[Alexandre II of Georgia|Alexander II]] *David  ==Notes== {{Reflist}}  ==References== *Ivane Javakhishvili, ''The History of the Georgian Nation'', vol. 3 (1982), Tbilisi State University Press, pages 320–340 (In Georgian) *Ronald Grigor Suny, ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'': 2nd edition (December 1994), Indiana University Press, ISBN 0-253-20915-3, pages 45–46 *[http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/georgia3.htm Kings of Georgia at the ''Royal Ark'' website]  {{s-start}} {{s-bef | before=[[Demetre III|Demetre II]]}} {{s-ttl | title= [[Kingdom of Imereti|King of Imereti]] | years=1463–1478}} {{s-aft | rows=2 | after= [[Alexander II of Georgia|Alexander II]]}} {{s-bef | before = [[George VIII of Georgia|George VIII]]}} {{s-ttl | title= [[List of the Kings of Georgia|King of Georgia]] | years=1465–1478}} {{s-end}}  {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME              = Bagrat 06 of Georgia | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = King of Georgia | DATE OF BIRTH     = | PLACE OF BIRTH    = | DATE OF DEATH     = 1478 | PLACE OF DEATH    = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Bagrat 06 Of Georgia}} [[Category:Kings of Georgia (country)]] [[Category:Kings of Imereti]] [[Category:Orthodox monarchs]] [[Category:Bagrationi dynasty of the Kingdom of Georgia]] [[Category:1430s births]] [[Category:1478 deaths]]"],["Universidade Nova de Lisboa",2085757,681010104,"2015-09-14T16:37:13.000+0000","Nova.comunica",15481131,"{{refimprove|date=January 2013}} {{Infobox University |name              = NOVA |native_name       = Universidade Nova de Lisboa |image_name        = Universidade_Nova_de_Lisboa_logo.png  |image_size        = 250px |caption           = |latin_name        = |motto             = Omnis Civitas Contra Se Divisa Non Stabit |mottoeng          = All the city divided against itself will not remain |established       = 1973 |closed            = |type              = [[Public university|Public]] |affiliation       = |endowment         = |rector            = [[António Rendas]] |officer_in_charge = |chairman          = |chancellor        = |president         = |vice-president    = |superintendent    = |provost           = |vice_chancellor   = |principal         = |dean              = |director          = |head_label        = |head              = |faculty           = |staff             = |students          = over 19,000 (2014)<ref>http://www.unl.pt/guia/2014</ref> |undergrad         = |postgrad          = |doctoral          = |other             = |city              = [[Lisbon]] |state             = |province          = |country           = [[Portugal]] |coor              = |campus            = Main campus in Campolide, Lisbon and Caparica, Almada.

In metathesis, chemists break double bonds more easily by introducing a catalyst—that is, a substance that starts or speeds up a chemical reaction. Chemists began performing metathesis in the 1950s without knowing exactly how the reaction worked. This lack of understanding hindered the search for more efficient catalysts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.humantouchofchemistry.com/yves-chauvin.htm | title=Humantouchofchemistry.com | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/211/000139791/ | title=NNDB | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>  In the early 1970s Chauvin achieved a breakthrough when he described the mechanism by which a [[Metal|metal atom]] bound to a carbon atom in one group of atoms causes the group to shift places with a group of atoms in another molecule and explained metathesis in detail. He showed that the reaction involves two [[double bond]]s. One of the double bonds connects two parts of an organic molecule. The other double bond connects a metal-based catalyst to a fragment of an organic molecule. In metathesis, these two double bonds combine and split to make four single bonds. The single bonds form a ring that connects the metal catalyst, the organic fragment, and the two parts of the organic molecule. The metal catalyst then breaks off from the ring, carrying away part of the organic molecule. This process leaves the fragment attached to the remainder of the [[organic molecule]] with a double bond, forming a new organic compound. Scholars have compared this reaction to a dance in which two sets of partners join hands to form a ring and then split apart again to form two new partnerships.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2005/chauvin-facts.html | title=NobelPrize.org | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciencia/2015/muere-nobel-yves-chauvin-100765.html | title=Eluniversal.com | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>  Chauvin’s description of metathesis led [[Robert H. Grubbs]] and [[Richard R. Schrock]] to develop catalysts that carried out the reaction more efficiently. The three chemists’ work has enabled manufacturers to make organic compounds, including some plastics and medicines, using less energy because the required reaction pressures and temperatures became lower, and using fewer harmful and expensive chemicals, and creating fewer contaminant reaction [[by-products]] and [[hazardous waste]] that must be extracted from the desired synthetic. It was for this process they were awarded with 2005 Chemistry Nobel Prize.<ref>http://www.repubblica.it/scienze/2015/01/29/news/addio_a_yves_chauvin_nobel_per_la_chimica_2005-106070950/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2015/01/28/le-nobel-de-chimie-yves-chauvin-est-mort_4565396_1650684.html|title=Le Nobel de chimie Yves Chauvin est mort|work=Le Monde.fr}}</ref>  == Death == Chauvin died at the age of 84, on 27 January 2015 in [[Tours]], [[France]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/31/science/yves-chauvin-chemist-sharing-nobel-prize-dies-at-84.html | title=NYT | accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2015/01/chemistry-nobel-laureate-yves-chauvin-dies-olefin-metathesis Chemistry Nobel laureate Yves Chauvin dies aged 84]</ref>  ==Publications== {{refbegin}} * A.

The tradition of the Bargemaster dates back to 1215, with the signing of [[Magna Carta]] at [[Runnymede]].  The Bargemaster is responsible for the Royal Watermen, chosen from the ranks of the Thames Watermen, who operate tugs and launches on the river.

At the coronation, the Royal Watermen walk in the procession behind The Queen’s Bargemaster. At the [[State Opening of Parliament]], The Queen’s Bargemaster and four Royal Watermen travel as boxmen on coaches, guarding the regalia when it is conveyed from [[Buckingham Palace]] to [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] and back.

It was one of several [[B-movie|B-films]] in which [[William Shatner]] starred between the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series and ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. Other cast members included [[Tom Skerritt]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Ida Lupino]], [[Keenan Wynn]] and [[John Travolta]] in his film debut in a minor role. [[Satanism|Satanist]] [[Anton LaVey]] is credited as the film's technical advisor and appeared in the film playing a minor role.  ==Plot summary== A [[curse]] affects the Preston family, caused by their betrayal of the Satanic priest Jonathan Corbis (Ernest Borgnine). Corbis has harassed the Preston family for generations to obtain a Satanic book of great power. Corbis captures patriarch Steve Preston, who is allowed to escape to warn his wife and younger son about Corbis's wrath. He tells them to give the book to Corbis, but during a rainstorm he melts into a waxy substance.  Mark Preston (Shatner) takes the book, hoping to meet with Corbis and defeat him. In a [[ghost town]] in the desert, Corbis gives Preston a drink of water from an old hand-pumped well. Preston drinks but then spits out the bitter water. He challenges Corbis to a battle of faith, then draws a pistol and aims it at him. Corbis belittles this threat and Preston tries to escape, but he is surrounded by Corbis' followers. He produces a cross, but Corbis transforms it into a snake and Preston discards it. Corbis' followers capture Preston, and Corbis uses a ritual to erase Preston's memory in preparation for a ceremony later that evening.  Preston's older brother, Tom (Tom Skerritt), and his wife, Julie, search for Mark. They are accompanied by Dr. Sam Richards (Albert), a psychic researcher. Their search leads them to Corbis' church, where Corbis is performing a ceremony to convert Mark into one of his soulless minions; during the proceedings Corbis transforms into a Satanic goat-like being. Tom witnesses all of this; he is discovered by the Satanists but eludes capture. Later he and Richards meet at the Satanic church, where they discover that the source of Corbis's power is an ornate glass bottle known as \"The Devil's Rain\", which contains the souls of Corbis's disciples.  Corbis and the Satanists converge on the church. Richards threatens to destroy The Devil's Rain, but he is overpowered by the acolytes. He appeals to Mark's lost humanity and convinces him to destroy the bottle, which he does in defiance of Corbis' entreaties. A storm rages outside, and the Satanists melt in the rain. Tom and his wife make a hasty exit. As Tom holds his wife, it is revealed that he is actually embracing Corbis, and his wife's soul has become trapped within a new Devil's Rain.  ==Cast== * [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Jonathan Corbis * [[Eddie Albert]] as Dr. Sam Richards * [[William Shatner]] as Mark Preston * [[Ida Lupino]] as Emma Preston * [[Tom Skerritt]] as Tom Preston * [[Joan Prather]] as Julie Preston * [[Keenan Wynn]] as Sheriff Owens * [[John Travolta]] as Danny * [[George Sawaya]] as Steve Preston * [[Anton LaVey]] as High Priest of the Church of Satan * [[Woodrow Chambliss]] as John  ==Response== ''The Devil's Rain'' received a uniformly negative critical response, with the chief complaint being the incoherent storyline. The film's refusal to provide adequate scares was also widely criticized. [[Vincent Canby]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that \"''The Devil's Rain'' is ostensibly a horror film, but it barely manages to be a horror...It is as horrible as watching an egg fry.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E1DF1E3AE034BC4053DFBE66838E669EDE|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=Film: ''The Devil's Rain''|date=August 8, 1975|accessdate=September 21, 2010|subscription=yes |work=The New York Times|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>  [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said \"All of this would be good silly fun if the movie weren't so painfully dull.

Fuest had previously directed ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971), ''[[Dr. Phibes Rises Again]]'' (1972), and ''[[The Final Programme (film)|The Final Programme]]'' (1973). ''The Devil's Rain'' suffered such a critical drubbing that Fuest immediately was forced to retreat to [[television]], directing several nondescript [[Television movie|TV-movies]] and series episodes over the years. He has made only one additional theatrical feature, ''[[Aphrodite (film)|Aphrodite]]'' (1982), a softcore sex romp shot in [[Greece]].  In his 2010 book ''Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies'', Australian film reviewer Michael Adams ironically called ''The Devil's Rain'' \"the ultimate [[cult film|cult movie]]\": \"It's about a cult, has a cult following, was devised with input from a cult leader, and saw [[John Travolta|a future superstar]] indoctrinated into [[Scientology|a cult he'd help popularize]].\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Michael|title=Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies|chapter=That's Travolting!|page=107|isbn=978-0-06-180629-2|date=January 2010|publisher=''!t'' Books ([[HarperCollins]])}}</ref>  ==See also== * [[List of American films of 1975]]  ==Notes== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *{{AllMovie title|13543}} *{{IMDb title|id=0072869}}  {{Robert Fuest}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Devils Rain, The}} [[Category:1975 films]] [[Category:1975 horror films]] [[Category:American horror films]] [[Category:American films]] [[Category:English-language films]] [[Category:Films directed by Robert Fuest]] [[Category:Ghost films]] [[Category:Satanism in popular culture]]"],["Wildpark",2952555,544166436,"2013-03-14T19:06:08.000+0000","Addbot",6569922,"'''Wildpark''' may refer to:  *[[Wildparkstadion]], a sports arena in Karlsruhe, Germany *[[Wildpark, Derbyshire]]  {{Disambig}}  [[de:Wildpark]] {{Short pages monitor}}<!-- This long comment was added to the page to prevent it being listed on Special:Shortpages.

Despite his position atop the marquee, Sheene does not appear in about 80% of the film's footage.  Much of the filming of the race sequences with [[Barry Sheene]] took place at [[Donington Park]] race circuit close to [[East Midlands Airport]]. Many of the stunts were arranged by Stunt coordinator [[Roy Alon]].  ==Soundtrack== An outstanding feature of the film is the use of hit songs from the era as narration; songs such as \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]], \"Glittering Prize\" by [[Simple Minds]], and \"[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]\" by [[Duran Duran]] are used to add to the mood.  ==Home media== ''Space Riders'' was released on [[VHS]], but, as of 2013, not on [[DVD]].  ==See also== * ''[[Silver Dream Racer]]''  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== * {{IMDb title|0316649|Space Riders}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Space Riders}} [[Category:1984 films]] [[Category:1980s biographical films]] [[Category:1980s drama films]] [[Category:British films]] [[Category:British biographical films]] [[Category:British drama films]] [[Category:British sports films]] [[Category:English-language films]] [[Category:Films shot in Kent]] [[Category:Films shot in Italy]] [[Category:Films shot in London]] [[Category:Motorcycle racing films]]"],["Money, Marbles, and Chalk",2391890,468230576,"2011-12-29T07:53:22.000+0000","Klemen Kocjancic",71061,"{{Infobox song <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Songs --> | Name           = Money, Marbles, and Chalk | Cover          =  | Border         =  | Caption        =  | Type           =  | Artist         = Garner Eckler | alt Artist     = [[Patti Page]] | Album          =  | Published      =  | Released       =  | track_no       =  | Recorded       = 1949 | Genre          = Country music | Language       = English | Length         =  | Writer         = Garner Eckler | Composer       =  | Label          =  | Producer       =  | Tracks         =  | prev           =  | prev_no        =  | next           =  | next_no        =  | Misc           =  | Audio sample?  = }} \"'''Money, Marbles, and Chalk'''\" is a [[popular music|popular]] [[song]], written by Garner \"Pop\" Eckler in [[1949 in music|1949]].

The official corps song is ''[[Russian Christmas Music]]'' by [[Alfred Reed]], first played by the corps in 1977, the year they won their first national championship.<ref name=\"rep\"/>  ===Bones=== Part of the mystique surrounding the Crossmen are references to \"Bones.\"  Immediately prior to the Crossmen's performance at major shows, Bones appears at the top of the back stands or in another prominent place to help inspire the corps' performance. Dressed in a 1978 Crossmen [[uniform]] with ankle-length red [[cape]] and a skull [[mask]], Bones arrives as the corps enters the field, spreads his cape to audience approval, and then vanishes once the Crossmen begin their performance. Bones is considered by some people to be a [[mascot]] and apparent fan of the corps. The reality is that Bones is an unidentified alumnus who appears as a reminder of the corps' traditions.  Bones is also the nickname for the corps and for the members who have marched there. The corps' most prominent motto is \"When all else is gone, the Bones always remain.\"<ref name=\"trad\">http://drumcorpswiki.com/Crossmen</ref>  ===Unity=== Unity is extremely important in the Crossmen, and corps members rarely travel anywhere in uniform unless they are paired with another member; traditionally, they also always move during rehearsal in concert with a fellow corps member.<ref name=\"trad\"/>  ===Age Out Crosses=== At one time, members of the brass and percussion sections replaced the red crosses on their aussies with the white ones prior to their final performance, but this did unacceptable damage to the aussies. Due to the efforts of alumni and supporters, each age-out now receives a white cross on a necklace before that final performance, a keepsake which can be worn forever.<ref name=\"trad\"/>  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *[http://www.crossmen.org Crossmen homepage] *[http://www.crossmenalumni.org Crossmen Alumni Association homepage] *[http://www.dci.org Drum Corps International]  {{DCI Nav}}  {start}  [[Category:Drum and bugle corps]] [[Category:DCI World Class corps]] [[Category:Musical groups from San Antonio, Texas]] [[Category:Musical groups established in 1975]] [[Category:1975 establishments in Pennsylvania]]"],["ABL (gene)",2412019,673036868,"2015-07-25T16:40:29.000+0000","Trappist the monk",10289486,"{{PBB|geneid=25}} '''Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1''' also known as '''ABL1''' is a [[protein]] that, in humans, is encoded by the ''ABL1'' [[gene]] (previous symbol ''ABL'') located on [[chromosome 9]].<ref name=\"pmid1857987\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Szczylik C, Skorski T, Nicolaides NC, Manzella L, Malaguarnera L, Venturelli D, Gewirtz AM, Calabretta B | title = Selective inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation by BCR-ABL antisense oligodeoxynucleotides | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5019 | pages = 562-5  | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1857987 | doi = 10.1126/science.1857987 }}</ref> c-Abl is sometimes used to refer to the version of the gene found within the mammalian genome, while v-Abl refers to the viral gene.  == Function ==  The ''ABL1'' [[Oncogene#Proto-oncogene|proto-oncogene]] encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein [[tyrosine kinase]] that has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, [[cell division]], [[cell adhesion]], and stress response.  Activity of ABL1 protein is negatively regulated by its [[SH3 domain]], and deletion of the SH3 domain turns ABL1 into an [[oncogene]].  The t(9;22) translocation results in the head-to-tail [[fusion gene|fusion]] of the ''[[BCR gene|BCR]]'' and ''ABL1'' genes, leading to a [[fusion gene]] present in many cases of chronic [[myelogenous leukemia]]. The DNA-binding activity of the ubiquitously expressed ABL1 tyrosine kinase is regulated by [[CDC2]]-mediated [[phosphorylation]], suggesting a cell cycle function for ABL1.  The ''ABL1'' gene is expressed as either a 6- or a 7-kb mRNA transcript, with alternatively spliced first exons spliced to the common exons 2-11.<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ABL1 v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25| accessdate = }}</ref>  == Clinical significance == [[File:3CS9 Abl1 Nilotinib.png|250px|left|thumb|ABL1 kinase domain (blue) in complex with the second-generation [[Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor]] [[nilotinib]] (red)]] Mutations in the ''ABL1'' gene are associated with [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML).  In CML, the gene is activated by being [[Chromosomal translocation|translocated]] within the [[BCR gene|BCR]] (breakpoint cluster region) [[gene]] on chromosome 22.  This new [[fusion gene]], ''BCR-ABL'', encodes an unregulated, cytoplasm-targeted tyrosine kinase that allows the cells to proliferate without being regulated by [[cytokines]]. This, in turn, allows the cell to become [[cancerous]].  This gene is a partner in a [[fusion gene]] with the ''BCR'' gene in the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], a characteristic abnormality in chronic [[myelogenous leukemia]] (CML) and rarely in some other [[leukemia]] forms. The BCR-ABL transcript encodes a [[tyrosine kinase]], which activates mediators of the [[cell cycle]] regulation system, leading to a clonal [[myeloproliferative disorder]]. The BCR-ABL protein can be inhibited by various small molecules.  One such inhibitor is [[imatinib|imatinib mesylate]], which occupies the tyrosine kinase domain and inhibits BCR-ABL's influence on the [[cell cycle]].  Second generation [[Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor|BCR-ABL tyrosine-kinase inhibitor]]s are also under development to inhibit BCR-ABL mutants resistant to imatinib.  == Interactions ==  Abl gene has been shown to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with: {{div col|colwidth=15em}} * [[ABI1]],<ref name=pmid12672821>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tani K, Sato S, Sukezane T, Kojima H, Hirose H, Hanafusa H, Shishido T | title = Abl interactor 1 promotes tyrosine 296 phosphorylation of mammalian enabled (Mena) by c-Abl kinase | journal = J.

His missives impressed [[DC Comics]] editor [[Julius Schwartz]] enough for Schwartz expand the letter columns in some titles to a second, separate page (such as \"Flash-Grams — Extra\", \"Letters To the Batcave — Extra\", and \"JLA Mailroom — Special Peter Sanderson Edition\") to facilitate Sanderson's analysis.<ref>Hembeck, Fred.

Retrieved July 2, 2008.</ref> In the early 1980s Sanderson wrote for comic [[fanzine]]s.  From there, Sanderson broke into the comic book industry proper; he was first hired by DC Comics, where he was given the task of reading every comic book published by the company since 1935. His research was used by [[Len Wein]] to write ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]''.<ref>[http://www.lib.msu.edu/comics/rri/srri/sanderso.htm Index to Comic Art Collection]</ref> Sanderson then went to work for Marvel as their first (and only) [[archivist]],<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Marvel-Vault-Museum-book-Collectibles/dp/product-description/0762428449 Marvel Vault]</ref> and contributed as a researcher on the various ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' series in the 1980s and early 1990s.  Sanderson was also the writer of the ''[[Marvel Saga]]'' and ''[[Wolverine Saga]]'' [[limited series]]. These titles did not follow the typical art-centered comic book format; instead, the two series focused on text chronicling the fictional histories of comic book characters — rather than writing new exploits of the characters — that Sanderson culled from previous titles Marvel had published over the years. The text was supplemented by individual [[Panel (comics)|panels]] excerpted from the comic books that served as Sanderson's sources.  He writes an online column entitled ''Comics in Context'', which (in Sanderson's own words) is \"a weekly series of critical essays on comics, cartoon art, and related subjects\"<ref name=cineplex>[http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2006/06/23/comics-in-context-134-cineplex-men/print/ Comics in Context #134: Cineplex-Men]</ref> (those \"related subjects\" can run the gamut from [[List of films based on comics|film adaptations of comic books]], to other media that have been influenced by comics, such as ''[[Star Wars]]''). The series started on July 8, 2003 on the website ''[[IGN]].com'', but then moved to the [[Kevin Smith]]-affiliated website ''Quick Stop Entertainment'' on June 23, 2006; according to Mr. Sanderson, the \"Powers That Be\" in charge of IGN's comics section began to tamper with the titles of his columns and complain about some of the topics he covered, whereby a \"change of scenery\" was necessary.<ref name=\"cineplex\" /> After a seventeen-month hiatus, ''Comics in Context'' returned to the newly-rebranded ''[[Fred Entertainment|A Site Called Fred]]'' on January 19, 2010.<ref>[http://www.asitecalledfred.com/2010/01/19/comics-in-context-outfoxed/ A Site Called Fred]</ref>  Outside of his online writings, Sanderson has also had a number of books published (including ''The Marvel Vault'' and ''The Marvel Travel Guide to New York''),<ref>[http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2008/01/03/the-beats-annual-survey-2008-edition-part-2/ The Beat’s Annual Survey 2008 Edition Part 2]</ref> taught the class ''The Graphic Novel as Literature'' at [[New York University]],<ref>[http://www.scps.nyu.edu/export/sites/scps/pdf/bulletin/spring-2008/scps-humanities.pdf NEWYORKUNIVERSITYBULLETIN]</ref> [[Curator|curated]] an exhibition on [[Stan Lee]] for the [[Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art]],<ref>[http://www.moccany.org/exhibit-stanlee.html MoCCA]</ref> and reviews the latest in comics and comics-related material for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.  ==Bibliography==  ===Comics=== *''[[Marvel Saga]]'': ** ''[[Essential Marvel]] Saga: Volume 1'' (440 pages, January 2008, ISBN 0-7851-2727-5) ** ''Essential Marvel Saga: Volume 2'' (472 pages, December 2008, ISBN 0-7851-2728-3)  ===Books=== *''Marvel Universe: The Complete Encyclopedia of Marvel's Greatest Characters'' (256 pages, Harry N.

Fortescue''' (who was ''not'' born 1868) was a nonexistent [[United States|US]] surgeon and founder of the '''International Board of Hygiene''' that the [[League of Nations]] recognised in 1926.  Honorable J. Fortescue was a brainchild of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] pathologist '''Rawson Pickard'''. The International Board of Hygiene was little else than a group of drinking friends who had founded it in a Turf Bar in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], during the [[Prohibition]]. The original Sir [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]] (1385-1479) was an English lawyer.  Because most of the meetings were organised outside the borders of the USA, the Board had to be international, and because many of the members were medical professionals, its theme was [[hygiene]] (The League of Nations already had its own International Board of Health). Anyone who had attended the meeting once became a lifetime member. On October 21, 1926 Pickard sent a long letter to the League of Nations HQ in Geneva and received recognition in a couple of weeks.  In the following years, various organisations and publications expressed interest about the Board and its reclusive president Fortescue. The [[United States National Research Council]] included him in a directory of child psychologists and he was invited to join the [[American Conference on Hospital Service]]. Pickard wrote very many articles in Fortescue's name and answered journalistic enquiries in his stead. Apparently none of the recipients ever bothered to check his credentials.  At the same time, the membership of the International Board of Hygiene spread by invitation. Every meeting was concluded with the reading of a scientific paper.   In 1936 ''Who's Who in San Diego'' included an entry about Fortescue, listing his multiple publications, memberships in associations, medical studies and travels, including winning the Fleischmann prize (actually a letter-writing contest for [[Fleischmann's Yeast]]). It also claimed that his mother was [[Lola Montez]] and that he lived in Paris. His only official address was \"The International Board of Hygiene, 1908 Eutaw Place, [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]\". Some of the studies would have been really groundbreaking at the time, preceding such scientific studies like [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction|Kinsey surveys]].  Rawson Pickard died in 1963. The correspondence of the Honorable J. Fortescue ceased as well.  ==References== {{cite journal| last=Graves| first=Clifford L.| title=The Hon. J. Fortescue, Esq.

They were founded in 1936, and since then they have spent 41 seasons in the [[Liga I|top-flight]]. Brașov kits are yellow-black, and they play their home matches on the [[Stadionul Silviu Ploeșteanu|Silviu Ploeșteanu]] stadium.  ==History==  ===Early modern football in Brașov=== \"Prehistoric\" football in Brașov started between 1912 and 1914. In 1927, the unrelated [[Colțea Brașov]] won a major title. In the second edition of Division C (1937–1938), the team Brașovia had given way to the new team \"Astra\" Brașov, founded a year earlier in 1936, which developed through the years to the current team from the foot of the mountain Tâmpa, FC Brașov. Players from this precursor of FC's in '37 may be considered the first generation in the team history. Ten of them are mentioned by the press: Năftănăilă (no relation to Lulu Năftănăilă from the later history of the club), Aurel Stroe, Pitu, Chicomban (a known family of multiathletes), Danciu, Pedra, Chirică, Dumitrescu, A. Iftimie, Dănăilă, Dragan.  ===The generation of Silviu Ploeșteanu=== The Second World War paralyzed the world of football, although there were a few competitions like \"The Cup of Bessarabia\" or \"The Heroes Cup\". Immediately after the armistice, various teams began to emerge throughout Romania, for the most part related to industrial establishments, universities or the military.  Yet one more time we find the Brașov team in Division C – series XII, as \"UAB\". This constellation is the starting point of the team that manager Silviu Ploeșteanu, with firm hands and professionalism, will bring to the second place in the first division and to winning the first Balkan Interclub Cup. We consider this to be the second generation, the generation that finally succeeded to break into Division B, in 1950.  This is the generation that Silviu Ploeșteanu managed to become a great team, winners of \"The Balkan Cup\" and players on the front stage among Romanian clubs. In 1960 the team places itself as number two on the front stage. This is the generation of Nicolae Proca, Gheorghe Fusulan, Gheorghe Ciripoi, Tică Constantinescu, Gheorghe Percea, Octavian Zaharia and Gheorghe Raicu; later supplemented by Stephen Hidișan (who continued as coach, a discoverer of talent), Nicolae Campo, Ioan Szigeti, Alexandru Meszaroși, Vasile Szeredai, Dorin Gane, Valer Târnăveanu and Necula Dorin.  ===The generation of the Mexican trio=== The following generation is the one of the trio [[Nicolae Pescaru]] – [[Stere Adamache]] – [[Mihai Ivăncescu]], the generation that provided three players to the Romanian national team at the World Cup in Mexico 1970. For a province team this was an extraordinary achievement, especially as they then played in Division B, even if the demotion (starting in 1968) was due to factors unrelated to the playing proficiency of the team.  The death of Iuliu Năftănăilă on 28 August 1967 gave the club a terrible shock from which it did not recover. Not only had Brașov lost one of its greatest talents, there was also the obtuseness of the federation, which did not agree to postpone the match with U Cluj just 48 hours after the funeral. Still under psychological pressure, the team gave up and could not recover fast enough. This demotion resulted in the replacement of Silviu Ploeșteanu as the coach of the team. After only eight stages on the bench in the next edition of \"B\", Valentin Stănescu was assigned his position. The shock of being dismissed from the team that he had managed for 21 years led to his death in the following spring, on 13 April 1969.  This generation links to the names of Csaba Gyorffy, Iuliu Jenei, Călin Gane, Marcel Goran, Pete Cadar, Caesar Ardeleanu, Adrian Hârlab and Virgil Grecea – a generation consisting of some of the most long term team members.  ===The generation of the '80s=== <!--[[File:FC Braşov 1980s logo.svg|thumb|left|100px|FC Braşov's crest during the 1980s]]--> The generation of the '80s brought the team back on the first stage, after five years of penance in the second division. This was the generation of Vasile Papuc, Vasile Gherghe, Marian Paraschivescu, Valer Șulea, Costel Spirea, Vasile Bențea, Gherasim Chioreanu, Adrian Furnică, Constantin Manciu, Nicolae Bucur, Nicolae Adami, Mihai Panache and Petre Marinescu.  Others incorporated along the way were Marius Lăcătuș, Ion Batacliu, Nistor Văidean, Ion Mandoca and Dumitru Stângaciu, a generation that demoted the team into \"B\" for a season, but that also brought it back. They did not reach the foremost positions, as had the earlier generations, but still for a long time they maintained the flag of Brașov on mast-head. The generation of the '80s continued and merged with the generation of the end of the decade, when new stars appeared on the Brașov sky: Marin Barbu, Alexandru Csaba Andrași, Marian Mărgărit, Eugen Moldovan, Petre Lucian, Andrei Șanta and Ștefan Bălan.  ===A leap in the line of time and the World Cup of '94=== <!--[[File:FC Braşov old logo.svg|thumb|left|100px|Club logo during the 90's]]--> After the events of December '89, we reach the generation that sent Marian Ivan to the '94 World Cup in the USA. This is the generation of [[Tibor Selymes]], Ionel Pârvu, Laszlo Polgar, Emil Spirea, Sandu Andrași, Iulian Chiriță, Dorel Purdea, and Marius Todericiu, a generation that still had some of the most worthy players of previous generations. This is the generation which, as previously said, sent Marian Ivan to the World Cup, 24 years after the Mexican trio.  ===The new generation, an indigenous one=== Some of the players of previous generations came to the foot of Tâmpa from elsewhere, adapted and remained faithful to these lands, along with those that were born and formed here. In recent years, the junior teams of \"the flagmen\" have begun to produce young talents one after the other. The best of the best have been incorporated into the \"big\" group, others have been lent to teams in the lower categories, to grind. Traian Alexandru Marc, Marius Constantin, Romeo Surdu, Ioan Coman, Silviu Pintea, Ionuț Vasiliu and Dragoș Luca – the generation formed by \"Municipal\" or \"ICIM\", the generation that brought the titles of champions or vice-champions back to Brașov after a very long time. This generation was thrown into battle together with others that committed themselves to the fields of Brașov: Aurel Ghindaru, Vasile Ghindaru, Mugurel Buga, Laszlo Balint, Emerich Vascko, Cosmin Bodea, Daniel Isăilă, Octavian Cocan,Marcel Șandor, Mihai Stere, Robert Dani, Florin Stângă and the list could go on and on. A list that is sure to be filled with other names coming from the juniors, carefully prepared within the framework of the \"center\".  At the end of the 2008–09 season, the team finished 9th in the [[Liga I]].  ===2009–10 season=== The club started the 2009–10 season very well, ranking 1st in the [[2009–10 Liga I|championship]] at the end of the first 10 matches, with 7 points behind the 2nd placed team. In the [[2009–10 Cupa României|Romanian Cup]], they managed to reach the semi-finals, after eliminating one by one, [[CS Otopeni]], [[Unirea Urziceni]] and [[Gloria Bistrița]]. By doing this, they managed to equalize their all time best performance in this competition, after the ones achieved in the [[1951 Cupa României|1951]], [[1957–58 Cupa României|1957–58]], [[1961–62 Cupa României|1961–62]], [[1969–70 Cupa României|1969–70]], [[1978–79 Cupa României|1978–79]] and the [[1986–87 Cupa României|1986–87]] seasons. They were drawn against [[FC Vaslui]]. Neither team had ever reached the final before. FC Brașov lost the encounter.  ==Current squad== :''As of 26 August 2015''  {{Fs start}} {{Fs player|no= 1|nat=ROU|name=[[Alexandru Tănase (footballer)|Alexandru Tănase]]|pos=GK}} {{Fs player|no= 2|nat=ROU|name=[[Andrei Poverlovici]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no= 4|nat=ROU|name=[[Ionuţ Hlinca]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no= 5|nat=ROU|name=[[Şerban Moraru]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no= 6|nat=ROU|name=[[Adrian Puțanu]]|pos=DF|other=<small>on loan from [[FC Viitorul Constanţa|Viitorul]]</small>}} {{Fs player|no= 7|nat=ROU|name=[[Claudiu Codoban]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no= 8|nat=ROU|name=[[Vlad Olteanu]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no= 9|nat=ROU|name=[[Marius Matei]]|pos=FW}} {{Fs player|no=10|nat=ROU|name=[[Bogdan Rusu]]|pos=FW}} {{Fs player|no=13|nat=ROU|name=[[Daniel Mutu]]|pos=GK}} {{Fs player|no=15|nat=ROU|name=[[Daniel Ene]]|pos=FW}} {{Fs player|no=16|nat=ROU|name=[[Cosmin Letan]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs mid}} {{Fs player|no=17|nat=ROU|name=[[Horia Popa]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=18|nat=ROU|name=[[Ciprian Perju]]|pos=DF|other=<small>on loan from [[FC Viitorul Constanţa|Viitorul]]</small>}} {{Fs player|no=20|nat=ROU|name=[[Sebastian Ianc]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=21|nat=ROU|name=[[George Mareș]]|pos=FW|other=<small>on loan from [[FC Petrolul Ploiești|Petrolul]]</small>}} {{Fs player|no=22|nat=ROU|name=[[Alexandru David]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no=23|nat=ROU|name=[[Mihai Istrofor]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no=27|nat=ROU|name=[[Alexandru Burlacu]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Mugurel Buga]]|pos=FW|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}} {{Fs player|no=30|nat=ROU|name=[[Răzvan Avram]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=57|nat=ROM|name=[[Vlad Munteanu(Neagoe)|Vlad Munteanu]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=96|nat=ROU|name=[[Bogdan Căucă]]|pos=GK}} {{Fs player|no=97|nat=ROU|name=[[Claudiu Pamfile]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs end}}  ===Out on loan=== {{Fs start}} {{Fs player|no=|nat=ROU|name=[[George Monea]]|pos=MF|other=at [[CS Unirea Tărlungeni|Unirea Tărlungeni]]}} {{Fs player|no=|nat=ROU|name=[[Andrei Ispas]]|pos=MF|other=at [[Metalurgistul Cugir]]}} {{Fs mid}} {{Fs player|no=|nat=ROU|name=[[Vlad Boţia]]|pos=MF|other=at [[AFC Hărman]]}} {{Fs player|no=|nat=ROU|name=[[Dragoş Bleambu]]|pos=FW|other=at [[AFC Hărman]]}} {{Fs end}}  == Club Officials == {{col-begin}} {{col-4}} === Board of directors === {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Role ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Name |- | Owner | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Ioan Neculaie |- | Honorary President | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Romeo Paşcu |- | President | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Vasile Dochiţa |- | Managing Director | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Ilie Vâju |} {{col-4}}  === Current technical staff === {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Role ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Name |- | Manager | {{Flagicon|ROU}} [[Adrian Szabo]] |- | Assistant Manager | {{Flagicon|ROU}} [[Mihai Stere]] |- | Goalkeeping Coach | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Andrei Şanta |- | Fitness Coach | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Lucian Nicolau |} {{col-end}}  ==Honours==  ===Domestic=== <!--[[File:Liga I logo.png|20px]]-->'''[[Liga I]]''' *Runners-up (1): [[Divizia A 1959–60|1959–60]] [[File:Campioana Romania.png|20px]] '''[[Liga II]]''' *'''Winners (6):''' [[1956 Divizia B|1956]], [[1968–69 Divizia B|1968–69]], [[1979–80 Divizia B|1979–80]], [[1983–84 Divizia B|1983–84]], [[1998–99 Divizia B|1998–99]], [[2007–08 Liga II|2007–08]] *Runners-up (2): [[1976–77 Divizia B|1976–77]], [[1978–79 Divizia B|1978–79]]  ===European=== '''[[Balkans Cup]]''' *'''Winners (1):''' [[1960–61 Balkans Cup|1960–61]]  ==European record== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Historically, flattery has been used as a standard form of discourse when addressing a [[monarch|king]] or [[queen regnant|queen]]. In the [[Renaissance]], it was a common practice among writers to '''flatter''' the reigning monarch, as [[Edmund Spenser]] flattered [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] flattered [[James I of England|King James I]] in ''[[Macbeth]]'' and [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] flattered [[Lorenzo II de' Medici]] in ''[[The Prince]]''.  Flattery is also used in [[pick-up line]]s when attempting to initiate romantic courtship.  Most associations with flattery, however, are negative. Negative descriptions of flattery range at least as far back in history as [[The Bible]]. In the [[Divine Comedy]], Dante depicts flatterers wading in human excrement, stating that their words were the equivalent of excrement, in the [[Inferno (Dante)|8th Circle of Hell]].  An insincere flatterer is a [[stock character]] in many literary works. Examples include [[Gríma Wormtongue|Wormtongue]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Goneril]] and [[Regan]] from ''[[King Lear]]'', and [[Iago]] from ''[[Othello]]''.  Historians and philosophers have paid attention to flattery as a problem in ethics and politics.  [[Plutarch]] wrote an essay on \"How to Tell a Flatterer from a Friend.\"  [[Julius Caesar]] was notorious for his flattery.  In his [[Praise of Folly]], [[Erasmus]] commended flattery because it \"raises downcast spirits, comforts the sad, rouses the apathetic, stirs up the stolid, cheers the sick, restrains the headstrong, brings lovers together and keeps them united.\" <ref> Regier, Willis Goth.

It was broadcast every Saturday evening on [[GMA Network|GMA]]. The format is loosely patterned on the original ''[[Tawag ng Tanghalan]]''.  The program was hosted by [[Regine Velasquez]].  In the 2006 Star Awards for Television, Velasquez was awarded the \"Best Talent Search Program Host\" for the show.  ==Overview==  ===Format=== The competition begins with a long audition period; then for forty weeks, three contestants would compete each week in front of a panel of judges. The weekly winner challenges the winner the week before. The winner must be able to defend his or her title for four consecutive weeks in order to automatically qualify for the grand final at the end of the forty weeks. Then, a Pinoy Pop Superstar grand champion is crowned. The first two seasons' grand showdown took place in [[Araneta Coliseum]] on May 2005 and 2006 respectively, and was judged by [[Floy Quintos]], [[Jaya (singer)|Jaya]], [[Danny Tan]], [[Kyla]], and [[Jay-R]].  On the third season, however, there had become new rules. After the three contenders sing their songs on their own rendition, the second round would force them to sing their song, but not in their music type. For the weekly winner of four consecutive weeks, he or she will qualify for the prelimination showdown. The remaining finalists will compete for the grand showdown.  Rules were then again changed after the Pinoy Pop Superstar Year 3 Special: Fast Forward to Superstardom ''(this special consists of 12 wildcard finalists wherein Joyce Tanana won)''. On the first round, six contenders sing their song in favor to their capacity and genre. Three of them will be eliminated with judges' average scores. On the second round, the remaining three contenders will sing a different kind/genre of song. The weekly challenger will compete with the defending winner. The winner shall defend his title for four consecutive weeks ''(this time the defending winner can only reign his title for four weeks)''. The gathered finalists will compete for the grand showdown.  ===Prizes=== The prizes at stake include a house (from Crown Asia in 2005 and Filinvest in 2006), a car ([[Toyota Innova]] in 2005 and [[Chevrolet Optra]] in 2006), a recording contract with [[GMA Records]], and 1,000,000 [[Philippine peso|pesos]].  ==Season synopses==  ===Grand Contenders=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

It was originally recorded for the group's 1989 album ''[[Automatic (The Jesus and Mary Chain album)|Automatic]]'' and was released as a single in November 1989.  ==Background== In the UK, it was released in seven different formats, including four 7\" singles. One 7\" single was released per week, and one of them included a cardboard box to house the full set.  Although the song only made it up to #57 in the country where the band first found fame, the [[United Kingdom]], it peaked at #2 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in the [[United States]].  The song has been covered by several other groups, most notably the American alternative rock band [[Pixies]] on their fourth studio album, ''[[Trompe Le Monde]]''.  ==Musical style== Denise Sullivan of [[Allmusic]] described the song as a \"blueprint [[post-punk]] in the tradition of [[Joy Division]]/[[New Order]].\"<ref name=\"all1\"/> The song relies on a [[Keyboard bass|synth bass]] and a [[drum machine]],<ref name=\"popp\">{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/178388-makes-you-want-to-feel-the-jesus-and-mary-chains-head-on/ | title=Makes You Want to Feel: The Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Head On\" | publisher=[[PopMatters]] | date=January 21, 2014 | accessdate=November 24, 2014 | author=Ramirez, AJ}}</ref> latter of which provides a [[Pop music|pop]]-influenced [[New wave music|new wave]] beat.<ref name=\"all1\"/> While the song lacks the layers of [[guitar feedback]] of the band's previous works, it features a \"1950s-style riff,\" provided by [[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]].<ref name=\"popp\"/> The song's style was also compared to the sound of [[Beach Boys]].<ref name=\"all1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/head-on-mt0030443285 | title=The Jesus and Mary Chain - Head On | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=November 24, 2014 | author=Sullivan, Denise}}</ref>   ==Track listing== All tracks written by [[Jim Reid]] and [[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]], except where noted.  ;7\" (NEG42) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"In The Black\" - 2:59  ;7\" (NEG42XB) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"Terminal Beach\" - 2:25  ;7\" (NEG42Y) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"Deviant Slice\" - 3:00  ;7\" (NEG42Z) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"I'm Glad I Never\" ([[Lee Hazlewood]]) - 1:31  ;12\" (NEG42TE) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"In The Black\" - 2:59 # \"Terminal Beach\" - 2:25  ;CD3 (NEG42CD) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"In The Black\" - 2:59 # \"Drop <small>(Acoustic Remix)</small>\" - 1:52 # \"Break Me Down\" - 2:29  ;Cassette (NEG42C) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"In The Black\" - 2:59  ==Personnel== ===The Jesus and Mary Chain=== *[[Jim Reid]] - [[Singing|vocals]], [[guitar]], [[synthesizer]], [[drum machine|drum programming]], [[Record producer|producer]] *[[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]] - guitar, synthesizer, drum programming, producer  ===Additional personnel=== *[[Alan Moulder]] - [[Audio Engineering|engineer]] (\"Head On\", \"Drop\")  ==Pixies cover== {{Infobox single | Name           = Head On | Cover          = Pixiesheadon.jpg | Alt            =  | Artist         = [[Pixies]] | Album          = [[Trompe le Monde]] | A-side         = \"Head On\" (Single Mix) | B-side         = \"Planet of Sound\" (Live)<br> \"Tame\" (Live)<br> \"Debaser\" (Live) | Released       = {{Start date|df=yes|1991}} | Format         = [[7\"]], [[Cassette single|cassette]], [[CD single|CD]] | Recorded       = 1991<br> Master Control, [[Burbank, California|Burbank]];<br> [[Pacifique Recording Studios|Pacifique]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]];<br> Studio des dames, [[Paris]];<br> [[Blackwing Studios]], [[London]]. | Genre          = [[Alternative rock]] | Length         = 2:14 | Label          = [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] | Writer         = [[Jim Reid]] and [[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]] | Producer       = [[Gil Norton]] | Last single    = \"[[Letter to Memphis]]\"<br />(1991) | This single    = \"'''Head On'''\"<br />(1991) | Next single    = \"[[Debaser]]\"<br />(1997) }} \"Head On\" was [[Cover version|covered]] by the [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Pixies]] for their 1991 album ''[[Trompe le Monde]]''.

After a long debate with their record company in the United States &mdash; [[Elektra Records]] &mdash; the band relented and agreed to film a video, as long as the song was done completely live. Peter Lubin, the A&R representative of Elektra at the time, later explained the situation:<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 157</ref>  {{cquote|By completely live that means full band, vocals, cameras roll, video's done by the end of two minutes and 13 seconds.

Twelve cameras would be placed, \"dividing\" each band member into three blocks. Frontman [[Black Francis]] was happy with this idea, so [[Scott Litt]] was then hired to produce the video.<ref name=\"fg158\">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 158</ref><!-- Describe video --> After the video had been filmed, Elektra invited the \"whole decision-making team from [[MTV]]\" to view it. \"Head On\"'s video was then added onto MTV's rotation, with the video later receiving the \"Breakthrough Video\" award.<ref name=\"fg158 \"/>  ===Pixies' track listing=== All songs written by [[Black Francis]], except where noted #\"Head On\" (Single Mix) (Jim Reid and William Reid)&nbsp;– 2:20 #\"[[Planet of Sound]]\" (Live at [[Brixton Academy]], 26 July 1991)&nbsp;– 2:26 #\"Tame\" (Live at Brixton Academy, 26 July 1991)&nbsp;– 2:27 #\"[[Debaser]]\" (Live in Chicago, 9 August 1989)&nbsp;– 2:41  ==References== *Frank, Josh; Ganz, Caryn. \"[[Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies]].\" Virgin Books, 2005.

Thus they created the RDNA, having meetings near the athletic fields on the college grounds, and filled in this information on their obligatory 'chapel slips'.<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 152-153.</ref> As Nelson remarked, \"The sole motive was to protest the requirement, not to try for alternatives for worship… There was never any intention to mock any religion; it was not intended that RDNA should compete with or supplant any faith. We tried to write a service which could be attended 'in good faith' by anyone.\"<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 153.</ref>  The RDNA believed that the college authorities would have to accept theirs as a valid form of worship, and that if they didn't then they would be guilty of hypocrisy.<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 153.</ref> The dean of men did nothing, choosing to ignore the group, neither accepting their chapel slips nor taking disciplinary action against them. The dean of women on the other hand chose to accept the chapel slips submitted by the two female members of the RDNA.<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 153.</ref> In 1964, the college abolished the rule requiring the attendance of religious services, and the college's President Nason and his wife actually chose to attend the final RDNA ceremony of that academic year. Nason failed to point out that the consumption of whiskey was a part of the rite despite the fact that the consumption of alcoholic drinks was against the college rules.<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 153-154.</ref>  After extended discussion with the Druids, the college recognized that its position was untenable, and, in part because of the challenge from the Druids, the religious requirement was dropped in June, 1964. But in creating an effective vehicle to challenge the requirement, the founders had unwittingly fostered an environment for spiritual exploration that many found rewarding. For many Druids the movement had come to represent a valuable part of their spiritual lives, and the founders were stunned to discover that the demand for Druid services continued even after the college requirement disappeared.<ref>[[#Tys92|Tyson 1992]]. p. 153.</ref>  ==Principles== Reformed Druidism emphasizes its lack of institutionalized dogma. Each Druid is required only to adopt these basic tenets: *One of the many ways in which the object of Man’s search for religious truth can be found is through Nature. *Nature, being one of the primary concerns in Man’s life and struggle, and being one of the objects of Creation, is important to Man’s spiritual quests.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  The original group were not Neo-Pagan — most identified themselves as Jewish, Christian, agnostic, atheist, Marxist or as members of other faiths<ref>[[#Bon06|Bonewits 2006]], p. 89</ref> — and the movement still includes many who do not consider themselves Neo-Pagan.  [[Chas S. Clifton]], an academic scholar of Neopaganism, made several suggestions as to where the early RDNA founders may have got their ideas about Druidry from, noting that there were British Druid groups such as the [[Ancient Druid Order]] operating at the time, who held annual ceremonies at the megalithic monument of [[Stonehenge]] in Wiltshire, attracting much media attention. Accompanying this, there were ideas about the ancient druids to be found in the \"American literary consciousness\", where they appeared as guardians of the natural world in the Romanticist poetry of [[Philip Freneau]].<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 153.</ref>  Clifton's speculations are in contrast to the actual motivations for Reformed Druidism. In fact,  at a meeting in Fisher's dormitory room about the religious requirement, Cherniack volunteered that his family had always responded to questions about religion by claiming to be Druids, and the group adopted this moniker.  When someone pointed out that none of the group knew anything at all about Druids, the suggestion quickly arose that the new group call itself The '''Reformed''' Druids '''of North America''', so it could create tenets and rituals out of whole cloth without having to know or care anything about any previous Druids.<ref>Personal recollection, Howard Cherniack</ref>  ==Ritual== In accord with the Basic Tenets, Reformed Druid worship is directed toward Nature. Services involve gathering in a wooded place periodically (the original group met weekly during warm weather) and on the festival days of Northern European Pagan tradition.  Services typically include: *The ritual consumption of \"spirits\" ([[Scotch whisky]] blended with water), called \"the Waters-of-Life\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} *The singing of religious songs. *The performance of ceremonial [[chanting]]. *[[Prayer]]s and [[meditation]]s. The written liturgy<ref>[http://orgs.carleton.edu/Druids/ARDA/ARDA-03.pdf RDNA liturgy]</ref> calls for a \"sacrifice of life\".  An early disagreement, recounted in ''The Druid Chronicles'', was resolved by limiting the sacrifice to plant life, whence the term \"Reformed\" was adopted as part of the group's name.<ref>[http://orgs.carleton.edu/druids/ARDA/ARDA-01.pdf The Druid Chronicles]</ref>  According to ancient Druid custom, the officiating Druids, and others who so wish, traditionally wear long white robes, the robe of the Arch-Druid having a distinctive decoration or color. The Waters-of-Life are usually passed to all present as a symbol of the link man has with Nature. Incantation recalling ancient [[Celtic mythology]] is also used. In order to focus attention on Nature, various aspects of it retain the names of corresponding Celtic gods and goddesses. For example:{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} *[[Dalon Ap Landu]] – the grove *[[Grannos]] – healing springs *[[Mars (mythology)#Celtic Mars|Braciaca]] – malt *[[Belenos]] – the sun *[[Sirona]] – rivers *[[Taranis]] – thunder and lightning *[[Llyr]]- the sea *[[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]] – fertility  ==Festivals== Druid festivals correspond to the important dates of the old Celtic year. Celebration begins at sundown the previous evening, and may include [[feasts]], [[bonfires]], and revelry appropriate to the season. The RDNA also adopted the ancient Germanic [[fire days]], or [[solstice]] festivals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Season of Geimredh (Winter) *[[Samhain]] – Oct. 31 *[[Winter Solstice]] – Dec. 21 Season of Earrach (Spring) *[[Oimelc]] – Feb. 2 *[[Spring Equinox]] – Mar. 21 Season of Samradh (Summer) *[[Beltane]] – May 1 *[[Summer Solstice]] – June 21 Season of Foghamhar (Fall) *[[Lugnasadh]] – Aug. 2 *[[Autumn Equinox]] – Sept. 21  (The original group, and ''The Druid Chronicles'', did not include the equinoxes — for which there is little evidence in ancient Northern European tradition — but they are now observed by many Reformed Druids.){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  The phases of the moon are also followed closely, but in practice rarely celebrated in a liturgical manner, except by modern groves with a neopagan focus or women's mysteries. Projects are started on a waxing moon and completed on a waning moon. The night of the full moon is considered a time of rejoicing; while the night of the new moon is a solemn occasion, calling for vigils and meditation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ==Organization== A great majority of the followers of Reformed Druidism are not currently in a group, especially with the advent of information on the internet. There are two types of groups within the RDNA: [[grove (Reformed Druids of North America)|groves]] and [[proto-grove]]s. A grove is a group of Druids who have been established, usually at least three members, and who have a third order Druid as their Arch-Druid. The Carleton grove established the tradition of three officers (though this structure is not mandatory): *Arch-Druid, a third order priest, to direct worship; *Preceptor, a second order Druid, to handle business matters; *Server, a first order Druid to assist the Arch-Druid. A proto-grove is a beginning grove that has no third order Druid; these are typically smaller than a regular grove.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  To become a first order Druid, a person must partake of the Waters-of-Life, and affirm their acceptance of the Basic Tenets. To become a second order Druid, one must pledge themselves to the service of the RDNA, as well as have an understanding of basic Druidism. To become a third order priest, one must dedicate oneself to a life of Druidic inquiry, starting with an all-night, outdoor [[vigil]].  {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  All three of the main orders are bestowed by an ordination script which is inserted within a regular liturgy. The affirmation of the two tenets and partaking of the waters is the script for the first ordination, often followed by tracing the Druid Sigil on their forehead by the Arch Druid.  The second ordination poses a series of questions about the waters-of-life, followed by an ordeal of a large drink of the waters-of-life.  The third ordination normally follows a period of tutelage, a vigil, and a sunrise ceremony in which the ordainer passes on the apostolic succession and assists in the new priest's first consecration of the waters-of-life.  In cases of undue geographic isolation, such ordinations have occurred by telephone or proxy.  Ordinations traditionally occur during the Season of Life, between Beltane and Samhain, emergencies excepted.  Higher orders of the priesthood (up to the tenth) recognize outstanding insight and dedication over a period of time. They are similar to [[academic degree]]s in that they represent recognition of personal achievement, but carry no special authority. Each order of the priesthood is dedicated to one of the eight aspects of [[Nature]].  As of 1967 only the fourth through seventh were completed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ===Council of Dalon Ap Landu=== The Council of Dalon ap Landu is the collective body of all Third Order Druids, chaired by the Arch-Druid of Carleton. In it rests the legislative authority of the movement. From 1964 to 1981, several proposals were considered by the Council, which by tradition has operated by consensus. The last passing resolution, in 1971, unequivocally gave equal status to female and male Druids in the Third Order and higher orders.  ====Priestesses==== Early tradition, as noted in ''The Druid Chronicles'', had originally restricted voting to men, and limited the number of orders a woman could belong to.  The first woman (Dannie Hotz) was ordained to the Third and Fourth Orders in 1965, when Priestesses gained the right o become Arch-Druids, Vigil unto the Third Order, and to officiate services.  This was again clarified by a vote in 1966. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Women incrementally increased their authority and liberty between 1964 and 1970, and women did vote before 1971. The Council of Dalon Ap Landu was led by a woman 1968-1969, since Marta Peck was the first Archdruidess of Carleton. After 3 years of discussion, the 1971 decision was passed unanimously by male voters, acknowledging de facto changes and removing any distinction based on gender.  Women constitute currently about 40% of the historical membership of the priesthood and Archdruidcies.  ====Isaac Affair==== During the [[Isaac Bonewits|Isaac]] Affair of 1974–1977, disagreement over the future of the Reform led to several split votes, which led to schisms, new Councils, and the end of the practical use of the Council of Dalon Ap Landu, due to the rising number of priests, the difficult logistics of voting, and the tradition of consensus. The Council of DAL remains in existence, but is effectively in permanent [[abeyance]], acting both as a rhetorical muse to address in letters, and as a brake on any further organization of the Reform on a national level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ==Purpose== On a superficial level, it might now seem that the purpose of Reformed Druidism is merely to delve into the strange customs and rituals of the ancient Celts, and to have some fun doing it, and also to serve as a new and different type of protest movement. But, on deeper examination of the RDNA, it might be said to have an important purpose: *In communing with Nature, it seeks to promote a spirit of meditation and introspection, aimed ultimately at awareness of religious truth. *It encourages all to seek their own spiritual path through active engagement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ==Branches== In 1966, [[Robert Larson]], an ordained priest of the original Carleton Grove, moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where he and [[Isaac Bonewits]] founded a small Druidic group with connections to various [[wicca]]n covens, and groups which practiced [[ceremonial magic]]. This became known as the Berkeley Grove.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  In the mid-1970s, Bonewits sought to recast the RDNA as a Neo-Pagan organization with substantially more organizational machinery; but this met with resistance from several Druids from the Carleton Grove, which had never identified as Neo-Pagan, and saw no point in the organizational innovations.  Several groves subsequently broke off to form \"Branches\" of Reformed Druidism. From the RDNA, in 1976, a new order formed called the New RDNA (NRDNA), which organized under a Council of Arch-Druids, specifically to have a national body more responsive than the Council of Dalon Ap Landu. Some NRDNA groves wanted to restrict membership to Neo-Pagans, and experiment with changes to ritual and the structure of their groves; these became the Schismatic Druids of North America (SDNA). Groves not participating in these changes or schisms were, by default, considered the RDNA. The definition of \"Reformed Druidism\" stretched to include these variants, not just the RDNA, but the NRDNA, SDNA, and independent folk who just believed in the Basic Tenets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Each of these branches generally followed the same ordination formula for First through Third Orders; members of each branch would enter Higher Orders too. Any Third Order member of any Branch was still a member of the original Council of Dalon Ap Landu; but this Council had already stopped functioning for practical purposes. Other means of interaction between Groves were devised, but they also faded away.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Many members of the SDNA groves left in the 1980s to form the [[Ár nDraíocht Féin]] (ADF), taking a few lessons from Reformed Druidism with them—notably the Waters of Life, an RDNA invention. Currently, in most RDNA and NRDNA groves, members can belong to any or no religion; and due to the emphasis on Grove autonomy, and resulting Grove diversity, there is now little to distinguish between RDNA and NRDNA.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Today Ár nDraíocht Féin has groves present across the [[United States]], in [[Canada]], and in some other countries. There is also another group which was an offshoot from the ADF<ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/druid3.htm Druidic Groups and Information Sources], retrieved 12 February 2011.</ref> and considers its lineage to come from the Reformed Druids, the [[Henge of Keltria]]. They also have various groves and groups around [[North America]].  The most recent branch of the Reform Druids are the Reformed Druids of Gaia (RDG) in November 2006 that was founded by members from a side-order known as the Order of Mithril Star (OMS) which began in 2003.  OMS was inspired by thoughts and practices of the Church of All Worlds and the novel Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein.  Many members of RDG today do not ascribe to the customs of OMS anymore. RDG derives its priestly linneage from Cerridwen in 2006, they have different ordination procedures, study program and ordination rites.  As a result, the branch of the RDG and the branches of RDNA/NRDNA do not officially recognize each other's ordinations, although each forms similar roles, and respectful interaction and collaboration occurs.  The RDG has greater central organization, systemized membership fees, study materials, a separate majority vote law code by the Third Order, and don't observe a season of sleep between Samhain and Beltane.  The RDG's liturgies resemble those of the RDNA & NRDNA, and members often refer to the historical ARDA 2 collection of Reformed Druid materials that continued up to 2005. RDG has over 400 members and 35 priests and 20 groves. Interaction between the RDG and RDNA and NRDNA is very frequent and often cordial with some cross-over membership, although separate social media, websites and newsletters have given them somewhat distinct senses of identity.  ===Diversity=== Until 1983, except for a few fraternal Druid organizations with branches in the USA, Reformed Druidism was really the only publicly known type of neo-druidism in America. ADF provided a training program for Neo-Pagan Druids interested in [[Indo-European]] religious concepts, a strong central church-like structure, a liturgical formula, and a great number of council and rules.  The RDNA has provided a similar niche for laid-back, disorganized, eclectic Druidism with a vague philosophical/religious outlook that closes parallels the niche of the Order of Bards Ovates and Druids (OBOD) in Europe, which was founded in 1964.  Little interaction is believed to have occurred between the RDNA and OBOD before the late 1990s, each isolate evolving in parallel.  Over the years, many aspiring Druids joined ADF, borrowed some ideas and produced dozens of new groups of their own. Henge of Kelria was the largest offshoot, when this group split off for reasons of protest over training programs, charges of ineptitude, and a preference for only [[Celtic paganism|Celtic]] sources of inspiration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Similarly, the Order of Whiteoak borrowed material from ADF, RDNA, and Keltra, but produced primarily a core of material based on their own research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ==Literature== While Reformed Druids are considered the least organized and most playful Druids, their literature is perhaps the more extensively produced and archived of any modern Druid group in America. It is estimated that it would take 100 full days to read through the 7000 pages of the whole genre. Despite the sheer volume,  it is quite possible and common for prominent members to participate actively in a Grove or a conference for years without having read more than a few dozen pages, as the oral and living traditions are also quite vital and nuanced.  The written traditions were mostly composed by members of the Third Order priesthood, but the writers do not claim divine inspiration.  An understanding or agreement with the written material is generally not required for any office or ordination, but is more commonly browsed by members entering the second or higher orders, or when assuming office responsibilities in a Grove.  The literature is notably non-dogmatic, eclectic, leaning towards philosophic rather than magic in focus, and often written \"tongue-in-cheek\", with authors tending to poke fun at themselves.  Reformed Druidic literature has been an almost entirely open literature, unlike many fraternal or mystical Druid organizations that restrict material to initiates. Most earlier publications were limited in distribution, primarily by the cost of publication in the 1960s and 1970s, but available upon request.  While generally well-researched and crafted, Reformed Druidic materials are not intended as serious academic works, and are intended for its own audience.  Except of a few pamphlets, these materials have not been used for proselytizing.  Despite the Reformed Druids' lack of missionary impulse, many of the literary traits from Reformed Druidism were transferred to later groups that trace their origins to the RDNA. This is due in large part to the influence of Isaac Bonewits' fervent missionary and publishing efforts in newsletters, member guides, seminary materials and popular books from 1971-2010.  The literature of the major works have various distinct genres, including; the writing of epistles, drafting liturgies, collecting materials for meditative use, historiography, calendar and protocol guides, research tracts on modern and ancient Druidry, council records, oral histories, local event chronographies, teaching guides for new members, recruitment materials, terminology references, bardic material collections, and even game design.  In addition to the major printed collections that have grown exponentially larger every decade, several newsletters and magazines have been published, websites and talk groups have held online since the early 1990s. In other media, members of the Reform has produced full-length movies, albums, and an animated series.  Members of the Reformed Druid priesthood (such as Isaac Bonewits and more recently, John Michael Greer) have published short stories, novels, several books on religion, including modern Druidism, even though those works are not directly related to Reformed Druidism.  ===Major Works===  * 1964 The Druid Chronicles (Reformed) * 1976 The Druid Chronicles (Evolved) (first edition) * 1982 Druid Compendium (project aborted when ADF founded) * 1996 A Reformed Druid Anthology  * 2004 The Carleton Druid Collection * 2004 The Druid Chronicles (Evolved), third edition * 2004 A Reformed Druid Anthology 2 (Main Volume) * 2005 A Reformed Druid Anthology 2 (Green Books Volume) * 2005 A Reformed Druid Anthology 2 (Magazines Volume).  * 2009 Unofficial Welcome Pamphlet (first edition) * 2010 The Druid's Path (first edition)  ===Minor Works=== * 1966 Black Book of Liturgy * 1966 Green Book of Meditations (first edition) * 1974 Green Book of Meditations (second edition) * 1994 Orange Book of Apocrypha  ===Newsletters=== * 1977-1981 The Druid Chronicler * 1978-1981 The Pentalpha Journal * 1982-1991 A Druid Missal-Any * 1994 News from the Hill of Three Oaks * 1994 The Standing Stone * 2000-2008 A Druid Missal-Any * 2003-2012 The Druid's Egg * 2008–Present The Druid Inquirer  ===Movies=== * 1995 Gatorr: The Fighting Rabbit * 2011–2012 Desperate Druids, a webseries  ==References== ;Footnotes {{reflist||colwidth=30em}}  ;Bibliography {{refbegin}} * {{cite book |title= Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers and Other Pagans in America ''(revised edition)'' |last= [[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]]   |year= 2006 |publisher= Penguin |location= London |isbn=978-0-14-303819-1 |nopp=|ref=Adl06}} * {{cite book |title= Bonewit's Essential Guide to Druidism |last= [[Isaac Bonewits|Bonewits, Isaac]]   |year= 2006 |publisher= Kensington Publishing Group |location= New York |isbn=0-8065-2710-2 |nopp=|ref=Bon06|pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=Wp6YWCAtGJwC&pg=PA84&dq=Reformed+Druids+of+North+America&hl=en&ei=yIdtTaTMKoH4swPU1ry4BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Reformed%20Druids%20of%20North%20America&f=false 84–106]}} * {{cite book |title= Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America |last= [[Chas S.

From 1902 to 1974, Scalby was an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10136374&c_id=10001043]</ref>  Scalby is approximately 3 miles north of Scarborough, and is separated from the town's suburbs by the [[Scalby Beck]], which flows to the North Sea at [[Scalby Mills]]. Scalby is a nuclear village which is bisected by the [[A171 road|A171]] Scarborough to Whitby road. The older part of the village is west of the main crossroads and is focussed around a small but busy High Street. There are two pubs, a newsagent (replaced by a beauty salon in October 2013), village store, two restaurants and a local hair salon. In addition there is Scalby [[Methodism|Methodist]] Chapel and the Church Rooms. [[File:Scalby Beck and the Old Scalby Mills.jpg|thumb|left|Scalby Beck and the Old Scalby Mills]]  In modern times, as an artificial flood relief channel, much of the flow of the [[River Derwent, Yorkshire|River Derwent]] (which drains a large area of the [[North York Moors]] into the [[Vale of Pickering]]) has been diverted, (about {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} upstream of [[West Ayton]] and before it reaches the plain of the Vale of Pickering), into a new channel called the Sea Cut which runs east along a previously dry side valley (probably a [[glacial overflow channel]]) and into the existing [[Scalby Beck]].  The [[parish church]] of Scalby is St Laurence's. The church is the oldest recorded building in the village. Records show its presentation in 1150 by Eustace Fitz John. The chancel arch and pillars are of that time and the first recorded priest, inducted in 1238, was Henry Devon. It is designated a Grade II* listed building.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1148211|desc=Church of St Laurence|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>  Scalby belongs to the ward of Scalby, [[Hackness]] and [[Staintondale]], which the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] records as having a population of 3,953 over an expanse of 10,186 hectares.  The village is well served by sports facilities. Scalby Tennis Club is located to the east of the junction of the A171 and Station Road. The club has two floodlit courts and further use of two public courts adjacent to the private courts. Additionally there is the Scalby & Newby Lawn Bowling club which shares the site and the clubhouse. On a small hill behind the western limits of the village is the location of Scalby Cricket Club (Carr Lane playing fields which are held in trust by the Parish Council). During the winter months this doubles as a football pitch.  In January 2009, Scarborough Rugby club moved from their old grounds in Newby to a new purpose-built club on the northern edge of Scalby, adjacent to the [[A171 road|A171]].

The abbey's original church was destroyed in 1287 during the [[War of the Limburg Succession]]. The church was rebuilt, but was destroyed again in 1574 during the [[Eighty Years' War]], and in 1683 by the armies of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Under the jurisdiction of Abbot Jean Dubois, from 1711 until 1749, the abbey flourished. It was dissolved during the [[French Revolution]], when the church was destroyed for the fourth time.  The remaining buildings were left empty until 1844, when they were resettled by the last living monk of Val-Dieu from the time before the Revolution, together with four monks from [[Bornem Abbey]].  The abbey was closed again in 2001, when the last three monks left. Since 1 January 2002 a small [[Laity|lay]] community has lived there, under the leadership of [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] Jean-Pierre Schenkelaars, overseen by the regional ecclesiastical authorities, in association with the [[Cistercian]] Order.  ==Brewery== In 1997 the [[Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu]] was established in the abbey farm, and brews a range of [[abbey beer|abbey beers]] in the tradition of the former Val-Dieu monks. Their range includes a Belgian blonde (6%), brune (8%), triple (9%), as well as a grand cru (10.5%).  ==Sources== *[http://www.val-dieu.com/ Val-Dieu brewery] *[[De Tijd]], ''Vallei van kaas en siroop'', 24 December 2005  {{Commons category|{{#property:P373}}}} {{coord|50.69792|N|5.805|E|source:dewiki_region:BE-WLG_type:landmark|format=dms|display=title}}  [[Category:Cistercian monasteries in Belgium]] [[Category:1216 establishments]] [[Category:Religious organizations established in the 1210s]] [[Category:Basilica churches in Belgium]] [[Category:Christian monasteries established in the 13th century]] [[Category:Buildings and structures in Liège (province)]]   {{Belgium-Christian-monastery-stub}}"],["Neverending White Lights",3959881,662841213,"2015-05-17T23:03:33.000+0000","KasparBot",24420788,"{{Refimprove|date=August 2012}} {{Infobox musical artist | name = Neverending White Lights | image =  | caption = Daniel Victor promo photo | image_size = 250 | background = group_or_band | origin = [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]] | genre = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[pop rock]], [[indie rock|indie]] | years_active = 2005–present | label = [[Maple Music Recordings]], [[Ocean Records]] | url=[http://www.neverendingwhitelights.com/ www.neverendingwhitelights.com] | current_members = [[Daniel Victor]]<br />Assorted artists }}  '''Neverending White Lights''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] music collaboration project fronted by [[Daniel Victor]] from [[Windsor, Ontario]], and featuring several artists mainly from Canada and the [[United States]]. Daniel Victor performs all musical instruments, with most of his songs featuring guest singers. The idea behind Neverending White Lights is to present a sampling of different voices, styles, and artists, while retaining the 'focused' sound characteristic of a band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/neverending-white-lights/228/|title=Neverending's story, chapter II|accessdate=November 2007}}</ref>  ==History==  ===Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies===  At the age of nineteen, Victor began to drift apart from working in the 'band-like' environments from his adolescence and experiment with multi-tracking himself in the studio.  These early recordings eventually became the first batch of songs from his debut release, [[Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies|''Act I: Goodbye Friends Of The Heavenly Bodies'']].  Though proficient enough on most instruments, Victor felt that utilizing the same singer on every song could grow tired, and was all too common. The idea of movie soundtracks, compilations, and frequent collaborations on Hip-Hop records intrigued him, and he wanted to bring these ideas over to the indie-alt music world and create an entirely different sort of album: something he didn't have in his collection, but wanted to have. After making notes of all his favourite singers, he began sending compositions to the various vocalists he felt would be a good fit for the songs.  His idea was to create something more interesting than just another album by another band, something that offered a bigger experience for the listener.  He was finding himself more influenced by textural sounds, cinematic production and melancholy songwriting.  These were the basic attributes he tended to create given complete free rein on the music and production. He created worlds of ambience, melody, and emotion within each composition.  'Vibe' was very important to him.  It wasn't just about 'songs', but about environments; how and where they live.  He listed a wide range of influences, including:  [[Brian Eno]], [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Radiohead]], [[Sigur Ros]], Kent, and [[Massive Attack]]; though it's impossible to cite the amount of music Victor digested on a weekly basis that would serve as a foundation for NWL's sound.  For Victor, it was very important to have melody and atmosphere.  After Victor finished school, he spent all his time devoted to making the record he envisioned.  The name \"Neverending White Lights\" came to him one night after flipping through his old notebooks in search of key words.  The lyric stood out to him and gave him the sense of infinity and foreverness he was trying to create with the project.  It was also a metaphor for humans; he explains: \"There is an energy in people that doesn't go away when they die.  While the physical body stays on earth, the light escapes.  That is what we're made of, that never-ending light\".  With the premiss of the album's content starting to unfold, Victor deemed it important to make the album a concept record; an entire collection of sixteen songs all telling one story, in different ways.  This would be an ongoing story, from album to album, each with a different conceptual basis for the lyrics.  The albums would be the \"Acts\", and the songs would be the \"Scenes\", and of course, the various singers would become the \"Actors\" - much like a movie or stage play.  It was an ambitious undertaking for one person to put together with no help in the industry and no band to provide feedback, and this difficulty led him into some troubled territories.  His first actual collaboration for this album was a song called \"On Fire\" which he wrote alongside Switchfoot frontman Jon Foreman in San Diego California in 2001. The song did not end up on Victor's first record.  Instead, it was recorded for Switchfoot's Columbia Records release ''The Beautiful Letdown'', which went on to sell over 3 million copies.  After a very trying experience realizing this overly ambitious debut, Victor surfaced with the finished album in September 2005. It featured over a dozen guest vocalists, many of which were Victor's favourite artists.  He states: \"It means more to me to hold a burned copy of this finished concept in my hands after seeing it in my head for so long, than it does to actually release it to the world.  I'd rather just put it on my shelf to listen to now and then and reflect on what it means to have completed this personal musical ambition.\"  Act 1: Goodbye Friends Of The Heavenly Bodies features lead members of: 311, [[City & Colour]], [[Finger Eleven]], Our Lady Peace, Ours, Hum (band), Shudder to Think, The Velvet Teen, Age of Electric, The Watchmen, The Black Maria, Creeper Lagoon, Starflyer 59, Deckard, Supergarage, Evelynn, and Cirrus.  Though a completely unknown producer, the originality and creativity in the concept and music solidified their commitment to the project.  Victor wrote nearly all the music, produced, and performed all the instrumentation himself.  It's important to note that Victor insists on performing all the instruments on his albums himself.  This one-man operation from the writing process to the end product is the key element to the unique sound of Neverending White Lights.  There were several unreleased tracks written and recorded from Act 1 which have not yet been released.  These include the songs: \"John Dies At 56 ft. Mogwai\", \"Throwing Chairs ft. [[Switchfoot]]\", \"Shipbuilding ft. Unbelievable Truth\" ([[Thom Yorke]]'s brother), and \"This Is My Fate ft. [[City & Colour]]\".  On September 27, 2005, the album was released independently through Ocean Records Canada (Victor's own record label).  The first single, \"The Grace,\" which featured Canadian singer [[Dallas Green (musician)|Dallas Green]], was very well received;  finishing as the 6th most spun song on Canadian Rock Radio in 2006.  The music video eventually hit #1 on Much Music and Much More Music.  The album sold close to 40K copies in Canada, and garnered a number of awards and nominations, including a Juno nomination for Best New Artist.  A spring tour supporting Canadian legends Our Lady Peace soon followed.  The album was also met with vast critical acclaim across the country which quickly jump-started Victor's career as a writer, producer and entity.  This was also re-enforced by three music videos released as a trilogy for the album, all telling one long story through the vision of Director RT!  ===Act 2: The Blood and the Life Eternal===  After gaining a following in Canada, Victor had to come to terms with the expectations to out-do himself and make a stronger second album. Now that he had people's attention, this was his chance to really focus on showcasing who he is and what he's capable of delivering. There was an immediate pressure to write another 'hit' single and to work with the right singers in order to not tarnish the path he was paving. Instead of wallowing in self-doubt on his direction and material, Victor used the pressure to fuel himself creatively. He researched various concepts of interest to write about, initially choosing 'ghosts and spirits' only to find himself being the subject of hauntings and strange occurrences. He brainstormed further ideas and eventually decided to focus on the concept of 'Everlasting Life' - something that could serve as an extension of the previous album, but create something much different. The lyrics he wrote reflected themes such as vampire love stories and bloodlust (The Living / Black Is The Colour Of My True Love's Heart / Bleeds To An End), suicide/seeking shelter in the spirit world (Dove Coloured Sky / The World is Darker), and other variations on this topic. 'Blood' was a common image through the lyrics and artwork, representing life in its simplest form, and something strong, sexual, and powerful.  The album was recorded in Daniel's basement studio during the course of 2006/2007. Victor produced and mixed the album, performed the instruments, as well as obtained a new cast of vocalists. The content was influenced in part by the reverb-heavy 80's music of his youth, draped in haze and serving up big choruses for the ears; these nostalgic elements seeped their way into the production, citing artists like Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, and George Michael as influences. Act II didn't try to emulate their sound, so much as draw on the memories of the material as a playground for creativity.  On October 30, 2007, Victor emerged with this second release entitled: [[Act 2: The Blood and the Life Eternal|''Act II: The Blood And The Life Eternal'']]. The album featured members of the following groups: [[Aqualung (musician)|Aqualung]], [[The Raveonettes]], Mobile, [[Catherine Wheel]], [[Auf der Maur]], Hawksley Workman, Magneta Lane, Mellowdrone, and Ours. The lead single entitled \"Always\", was the first track to feature Victor himself on vocals and peaked at # 18 on the Canadian top 40 Rock Chart. It's uptempo driving sound marked a notable change in direction from the very slow tempos of the previous album and single. The video was influenced by movies such as 'Vanilla Sky' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' in the way in which it melded nostalgic memories together to tell a story. He later followed with a second single \"The World is Darker\" Ft. Melissa Auf der Maur (Smashing Pumpkins/Hole) which was the first video to feature the actual vocalist in it. The third and final single was \"Where We Are Ft. Rob Dickinson\".  The album was met with much praise and critical acclaim including and many 5 star reviews. Fans of the group gravitated towards NWL's progression of sound, story, and image, and Victor further solidified the project's identity.  In 2008, Victor took time off and decided not to tour the album. He spent time adjusting to his career and spending time with loved ones; something he had no time to do between the first two albums. It was also important to him creatively that he find a new place of inspiration and energy before writing another album from scratch. During this time he produced and recorded something entirely different to change his writing style. This project was called ''Black Ribbons'' and is a 12-song electro-pop-noir album that he produced and recorded in a few short months. He wrote every song on the bass guitar, which gave the project a different perspective of songwriting.  ===Act III: Love Will Ruin (2009-present)===  In 2009, Victor went to work on writing new material for Act 3. This time he knew exactly what he wanted to focus his concept on: Tragic Love. Love itself was a topic he had mostly stayed away from due to its commonplace in music, but he wanted to focus on a certain aspect of it - the longing, heartache, and sadness of it - and how there is beauty to be found there. Between mounting pressures to produce radio singles and to repeat past successes, yet to still maintain true to the artistic integrity NWL was founded on, writing and production was staggered and troublesome. Victor eventually went on to write and record nearly seventy songs for inclusion on this album, only to throw them away after spending much time and money to complete them. It wasn't until he had a 'finished' copy in his hands after two years of painstaking work and travel that he decided it was unworthy to be released as an NWL album, and threw it in the trash.  He started over from scratch and found inspiration deep within himself, instead of from outside influence and pressure. It was this personal freedom and revelation that allowed the proper album to surface. Victor stated that \"every song has to take you somewhere, every song has to hit you, and every song has to make you close your eyes and get chills. It was the letting go that allowed me to get to those moments. I tested them on myself, and these are the songs that have stood up for me.\" This batch of music became Act 3.  On September 21, 2010, Daniel leaked the first song from ''Act 3: Love Will Ruin'' entitled \"The Lonely War\", which features Evan Konrad of the band '[[Bed of Stars]]'. He also stated that due to difficulties with a rupture in his vocal cords, the official release date of the album was delayed from 2009 to late 2011.  In spring 2011, the first single/video from \"Act 3\" was released entitled \"Falling Apart Ft. Bed of Stars\". In October, the single \"Ghost Ship Ft. Hot Hot Heat\" was released, eventually peaking at #9 for 3 weeks on ALT Rock in Canada.  The album Act III: Love Will Ruin was finally released on November 18, 2011 to general critical praise. It features guest performances by Hot Hot Heat, Bed of Stars, and Pilot Speed. The album focuses more on Victor's own vocal performances and is generally more uptempo and rock than the previous releases. This change in style was a result of performing material live on stage over the years and finding the music taking on more of an edge. This increase in energy was also brought forward in an attempt to begin shifting NWL's sound to something more driving than downtempo and slow. This noticeable result can be heard on tracks such as \"Starlight\", \"The Lonely War\", and Falling Apart. Although the songs go over better in a live setting, many fans of the project's original style have criticized the change.  Victor is currently working on the 4th studio album in the Neverending White Lights series that will most likely be named \"Act IV\" in a follow up to \"Act III\". As of October 29th, 2014, it is currently slated for a late spring 2015 release. There is not yet any official word as to whom Victor will be collaborating with but it has been speculated that [[Deftones]]/[[Crosses (band)|Crosses]] frontman [[Chino Moreno]], singer/songwriter [[Active Child]], [[The Tea Party]], and [[Mother Mother]] might appear on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neverendingwhitelights.com/news/|title=Neverending White Light's site, news post from October 29, 2014|accessdate=November 2014}}</ref>  ==Discography==  === Albums === *2005: ''[[Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies]]'' *2007: ''[[Act 2: The Blood and the Life Eternal]]'' *2011: ''Act 3: Love Will Ruin''<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMVXJgrH5h0 Daniel Victor Exclusive Interview on 3rd Album].

The dancers, standing in several rows, may be further choreographed to execute different figures (including box, figure 8, circles, and half circles) while maintaining the hip-shaking. The hip motion itself may in some choreographies be synchronized amongst multiple dancers and may be further coordinated with the accompanying percussion arrangement.  The dance is with music only (drums) at a fast rhythm, and no singing. The drum can be one of the different types of the ''tō{{okina}}ere'', a lying log of wood with a longitudinal slit, which is struck by one or two sticks. Additional drum types accompanying the dance may include the ''pahu'' (the ancient Tahitian, standing drum covered with a shark skin and struck by the hands or with sticks) played at a slower rhythm, or the smaller ''fa{{okina}}atētē'' drum.  The {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a is one of the few dances which already existed in pre-European times as a male dance. (The ''hura'' (Tahitian vernacular for [[hula]]), a dance for women, on the other hand has disappeared, and likewise is gone the couple's dance [['upa'upa|{{okina}}upa{{okina}}upa]] but which may have reemerged as the [[tamure|tāmūrē]]). Nowadays, however the {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a can be danced by men ({{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a tāne), by women ({{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a vahine), or by both genders ({{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a {{okina}}āmui = united {{okina}}ō.).  Dancers of the {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a make gestures reenacting daily occupations of life. For the men the gestural themes can be chosen from warfare or sailing, and then they may use spears or paddles. For women the gestural themes are typically closer to home or from nature: hand gestures suggesting combing their hair, or the flight of a butterfly. More elaborate themes have been adopted; for example one where the dancers end up in a map of Tahiti, highlighting important places. In a proper {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a the story of the theme should pervade the whole dance.  The costumes are extremely elaborate, typically incorporating long plant fiber (\"grass\") skirts, belting with tassels that accentuate the hip-motion, may further include decorated headpieces, and may be color-coordinated across the dancers of the company.  The same ''more'' dress and the same shaking of the knees for the boys and those of the hips for the girls as in all Tahitian dances (see [[tamure|tāmūrē]]) is used here too.  The {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a is considered as Tahiti's best and most spectacular dance, maybe even of whole Polynesia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  ==Modern and Adoptive Interpretation==  Interpretations of the '''{{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a''' are frequently included as part of larger Polynesian dance recitals presented at luaus and visitor-oriented live shows in the Hawaiian Islands and other Pacific-rim resorts outside Tahiti.  Modern interpretations include costumes fashioned of contemporary man-made materials (polyester films such as mylar, or synthetic twines) substituting for plant-fiber or natural materials, and costume coloration such as fluorescent pinks and greens or mirror-reflective surfaces difficult to obtain or maintain from purely natural resources.  Modern drum accompaniments may include drums of European- or non-Pacific construction, improvised percussion instruments of modern materials (e.g. high-density polyethylene or metallic commercial food packaging), and the use of prerecorded drum reinforcement soundtracks.  Contemporary performances of the dance range in length from less than a minute to as long as five or six minutes, with company sizes as few as one dancer to several dozen of single or mixed sex at once.  ==References== *Patrick O'Reilly; ''La danse à Tahiti''.  {{Culture of Oceania}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Otea}} [[Category:Dances of Tahiti]]"],["Göteborg City Museum",4299833,677796956,"2015-08-25T15:45:29.000+0000","Johnpacklambert",2308770,"[[Image:Ostindiska huset september 2010b.jpg|thumb|350px|The City Museum of Göteborg (Gothenburg).]] The '''Göteborg City Museum''' ({{lang-sv|Göteborgs stadsmuseum}}) is in the city centre of [[Gothenburg]], western [[Sweden]].

He is recognized for his [[Surrealism|surreal]] digital photographs that have appeared on album packaging for recording artists, book jackets, and ad campaigns. Obermeyer practices a style of digital photography by collaging and \"painting\" parts of many of his photographs into one seamless amalgam. Obermeyer digitally cuts and manipulates even single strands of hair or folds in fabric. This process leads to a classification of his work between photography and digital illustration. He draws freely from many influences including classic [[children's literature]], [[mythology]], biological processes, aquatic life, music, and film.  ==Biography==  Obermeyer was briefly mentored by a painter at the age of 14 in Dallas. He attended college for a year in Texas before relocating to New York City for a graphic design internship in 1999. Despite the absence of formal training, Obermeyer rose from office intern to contributor, single-handedly undertaking major illustration projects for clients that included [[The Juilliard School]] and The Glaucoma Foundation.  Obermeyer left the internship after a year and established the graphic design firm ON Company with partner Eric Neuner. Obermeyer was responsible for designing and executing illustrations, imagery, and photographs for their design pieces. They achieved commercial success and received critical acclaim from the ''[[New York Times]]'' for \"excellence in design\" for their work with World Monuments Fund.<ref>Louie, Elain (October 12, 2000). \"Russia Struggles to Save Landmarks\". The New York Times</ref> Despite the accolades, he remained devoted to his artistic works. Many of ON Company's clients were directly affected by the unfortunate events of September 11 and the firm was forced to disband in 2002. Obermeyer returned to Texas to focus on his personal artistic endeavors.  ==Career==  [[Image:Lost & Found Ryan Obermeyer.jpg|thumb|left|Lost & Found - Created for recording artists [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], 2001]]  While still living in Manhattan, Obermeyer attended a concert featuring the cello rock band [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]]. A friendship with the singer [[Melora Creager]], founded on aesthetic similarities, was forged. Obermeyer created his first commissioned digital piece, ''Lost & Found'', for the imminent Rasputina CD release of the same name (2001). He was the youngest artist to be included at the 44th Annual [[Society of Illustrators]] Exhibition in New York with this piece. Obermeyer has since created numerous pieces for the band and has accompanied them on several unconventional American tours, selling books of his art while contributing backup vocals from the merchandise area. He conceived artwork for several of their subsequent releases including ''[[Cabin Fever (Rasputina album)|Cabin Fever]]'' (2002), ''[[My Fever Broke]]'' (2002), and ''[[Frustration Plantation]]'' (2004).   [[Image:Della V(email WIKI).jpg|thumb|right|Della Vigna I - Created for ''[[Darkhenge]]'' by [[Catherine Fisher]] 2004]]  While continuing his longstanding dedication to visualizing the aural projects of musicians, he has also been hired to realize several novelists' written works with imagery for book jackets and illustrations. His literary collaborations include several images for novels by [[Caitlín R. Kiernan]] and [[Catherine Fisher]].  [[Image:Sonar Ryan Obermeyer.jpg|thumb|left|Sonar - Created for Greenpeace Italia, Whaleless campaign 2005]]   In 2005, he was hired by [[Greenpeace]] Italia to create a special piece for a collective ad campaign (Whaleless) to promote the Save the Whales cause.  In 2006, Obermeyer was invited to be a contributor to the spoken-word film, ''Phone Sex'' from director [[Steve Balderson]] featuring phone message descriptions left by Obermeyer, [[Ron Jeremy]], [[Margaret Cho]], [[Edie McClurg]], and many others.  His most recent collaborations include recording artists [[Milosh]], Back Ted N-Ted, KaiserCartel, and [[Imogen Heap]] -previously of the band [[Frou Frou (band)|Frou Frou]]- producing several images to promote her solo album, ''[[Speak for Yourself]]'', including cover art for an exclusive Live Session (iTunes Exclusive EP), her single [[Goodnight and Go]], and her single  [[Headlock (song)]].

(accessed: January 14, 2008)]</ref>  ==Biography==  ===Dunhuang sojourn=== Whilst the East Mountain Teachings (pejoratively known as the \"[[Northern School]]\" Chan) were in decline, having been attacked by [[Heze Shenhui]] (a student of [[Dajian Huineng]]) as a supposed \"gradual enlightenment\" teaching, Moheyan  traveled to [[Dunhuang]], which at the time belonged to the [[Tibetan empire#Tibetan Empire|Tibetan Empire]], in 781 or 787.{{sfn|Ray|2005}} For Moheyan, this was a new opportunity for the spread of (Northern) Chan.{{sfn|Ray|2005}}  ===Council of Lhasa=== [[File:A grand view of Samye.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of the Samye Monastery]]  After teaching in the area of [[Dunhuang]], Moheyan was invited by King [[Trisong Detsen]] of [[Tibet]] to settle at [[Samye Monastery]], then the center of emerging Tibetan Buddhism.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik TCI\">[http://earlytibet.com/2007/11/13/tibetan-chan-i-the-emperors-chan Sam van Schaik (2008), ''Tibetan Chan I: The Emperor's Chan'']</ref> Moheyan promulgated a variety of [[Chinese Chán|Chan]] and disseminated teachings from Samye where he attracted a considerable number of followers.  However, in 793 Trisong Detsen resolved that Moheyan did not hold the true [[Dharma]]. Following intense protests from Moheyan’s supporters, Trisong Detsen proposed to settle the matter by sponsoring a debate.{{refn|group=note|[[Dialectic]] is an ancient aspect of the [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]], as it is in [[Himalaya]]n tradition.}} The most famous of these debates has become known as the \"Council of Lhasa\", although it may have taken place at Samye, a considerable distance from [[Lhasa]]. For the famed Council of Lhasa, an Indian monk named [[Kamalashila|Kamalaśila]] was invited to represent [[Indian Buddhism]], while Moheyan represented [[Northern School]] [[Chán]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]].  While Moheyan took a [[Subitism|subitist]] approach to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], his position was weakened when conceding that practices such as the [[Pāramitā|perfection of morality]], studying the sutras and teachings of the masters, and cultivating meritorious actions were appropriate. These types of actions were seen as part of the \"gradualist\" school, and Moheyan held that these were only necessary for those of \"dim\" facility and \"dull\" propensity. Those of \"sharp\" and \"keen\" facility and propensity do not need these practices, as they have \"direct\" access to the truth through meditation. This concession to the \"gradualists\", that not everyone can achieve the highest state of meditation, left Moheyan open to the charge that he had a dualistic approach to practice. To overcome these inconsistencies in his thesis, Moheyan claimed that when one gave up all conceptions, an automatic, all-at-once attainment of virtue resulted. He taught that there was an \"internal\" practice to gain [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] and liberate one-self, and an \"external\" practice to liberate others ([[upaya]], or skillful means). These were seen as two independent practices, a concession to human psychology and scriptural tradition.  Most Tibetan sources state that the debate was decided in Kamasila’s favour (though many Chinese sources claim Moheyan won){{sfn|Powers|2004|p=38-44}} and Moheyan was required to leave the country and that all sudden-enlightenment texts were gathered and destroyed by royal decree. This was a pivotal event in the history of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which would afterward continue to follow the late Indian model with only minor influence from [[China]].  Nevertheless, Chan texts were produced until the 10th century in Tibet, which casts doubt on these Tibetan sources.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik TCI\" />  ==Teachings==  ===Sudden teachings=== {{Main|East Mountain Teachings|Chan Buddhism|Subitism}}  Moheyan’s teachings were a mixture of the East Mountain Teachings{{sfn|Broughton|1983|p=9}}{{refn|group=note|Chinese: 東山法門 ''tung-shan fa-men''; given the appellation of \"Northern School\" Chan by Shenhui (670-762)}} associated with [[Shenxiu]] and [[Baotang]] Chán.{{sfn|Hanson-Barber|1985}} Broughton gives the following nomenclatura:{{sfn|Broughton|1983|p=9}} {{quote|Mo-ho-yen's teaching in Tibet as the famed proponent of the all-at-once gate can be summarized as \"gazing-at-mind\" (k'an-hsin... <nowiki>=</nowiki> sems la bltas{{refn|group=note|IOL Tib J 468: (1v) //bsam gtan nyId du ‘jug pa’I tshe/ bdag gI sems la bltas na/ cI yang sems dpa’ myed de myI bsam mo/ rtog pa’I sems g.yos na tshor bar bya/ cI ltar tshor bar bya zhe na/ gang g.yos pa’I sems de nyId/ g.yos pa dang ma g.yos par yang myI brtag/ yod pa dang myed par yang (2r) myI brtag/ dge ba dang myI dge bar yang myI brtag/ nyong mongs pa dang rnam par byang bar yang myI brtag/ ste// chos thams cad cI lta bur yang myI brtag go// sems g.yos pa de lta bur tshor na rang bzhin myed pa yIn te/ /de nI chos lam spyod pa zhes bya’//<ref group=web>[http://earlytibet.com/2008/05/15/tibetan-chan-ii-the-teachings-of-heshang-moheyan/ Sam van Schaik (2008), ''''Tibetan Chan II: the teachings of Heshang Moheyan''] (accessed: Saturday April 17, 2010)</ref>}} and \"no examining\" (pu-kuan... <nowiki>=</nowiki> myi rtog pa) or \"no-thought no-examining\" (pu-ssu pu-kuan... <nowiki>=</nowiki> myi bsam myi rtog). \"Gazing-at-mind\" is an original Northern (or East Mountain Dharma Gate) teaching. As will become clear, Poa-t'ang and the Northern Ch'an dovetail in the Tibetan sources. Mo-ho-yen's teaching seems typical of late Northern Ch'an. It should be noted that Mo-ho-yen arrived on the central Tibetan scene somewhat late in comparison to the Ch'an transmissions from Szechwan.{{sfn|Broughton|1983|p=9}}}}  The dichotomy of the gradual north and sudden south is a historical construction, as both Northern and Southern Schools contained \"gradualist teachings\"{{refn|group=note|Chinese: ''tun-men''}} and \"sudden teachings\"{{refn|group=note|Chinese: ''chien-men''}} and practices.  ===Liberation from ''vikalpa-citta''=== Gōmez gives a detailed account of the doctrinary differences that were at stake at the \"council of Lhasa\", based on Bu-ston's ''Chos-'yun'', which in turn may have been based on Kamasilá's ''Third [[Bhāvanākrama]]''.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}} Bu-ston had chosen two points to summarize the conflict, which entails complex doxtrinal and historical issues.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}}  Most of what is known of Moheyan’s teaching comes from fragments of writings in Chinese and Tibetan found in the [[Mogao caves]] at [[Dunhuang]], [[Gansu]], [[China]]. The manuscript given the appellation ''IOL Tib J 709'' is a collection of nine Chan texts, commencing with the teachings of Moheyan.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik TCI\" />  According to Bu-ston, the conflict centered around two theses set out by Moheyan:{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}} # \"As long as one carries out good or evil acts, one is not free from transmigration.\"{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}} # \"Whoever does not think of anything, whoever does not reflect, will be totally free from transmigration. Not thinking, not pondering, non-examination, non-apprehension of an object - this is the immediate access [to liberation].\"{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=71}}  yet, a principal point of Moheyan's teaching is that according to Moheyan, the root cause of samsara is the creation of false distinctions, ''vikalpa-citta''.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=74}} As long as these false distinctions are being created, one is bound to samsara.  ====Good and evil acts==== According to Bu-ston, Moheyan taught that carrying out good or evil acts binds one to transmigration.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=71}} Moheyan's point is that the concept of good or false is itself still conceptual thinking, which obscures enlightenment. If all thought, good or bad, obscures enlightenment, then all actions must be based on the simplest principles of conduct. To achieve proper conduct, all conceptions, without exception should be seen as false:  {{quote|If one sees conceptions as no conception, one sees the [[Tathāgata]].{{sfn|Gomez|1983|p=90}}}}  ====Not-thinking==== Sam van Schaik notes that Moheyan \"didn’t advocate the suppression of thoughts,\" but rather advised, in his own words: {{quote|[Y]ou should not suppress concepts. Whenever they arise, if you do not fabricate anything but instead let them go, then they will stay as they are and come to rest by themselves; thus you will not pursue them.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik TCIII\">[http://earlytibet.com/2008/06/10/tibetan-chan-iii-more-teachings-of-heshang-moheyan/ Sam van schaik (2008), ''Tibetan Chan III: more teachings of Heshang Moheyan'']</ref>}}  By practicing ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'', awareness should be reverted toward this awareness itself: {{quote|To turn the light [of the mind] towards the mind’s source, that is contemplating the mind [...] one does not reflect on or observe whether thoughts are in movement or not, whether they are pure or not, whether they are empty or not.{{sfn|Gomez|1983|p=93}}}}  By turning the attention inward, one discovers that no \"self-nature\" can be found in the movements of the mind.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=74-75}} Eventually, dhyana leads to the realisation that awareness is [[Sunyata|empty]], and cannot be grasped by concepts: {{quote|When he enters a state of deep contemplation, he looks into his own mind. There being no-mind, he does not engage in thought. If thoughts of discrimination arise, he should become aware of them [...] Whatever thoughts arise, one does not examine [...] He does not examine any dharma whatsoever. If he becomes aware in this way of the arising (of thoughts, he perceives) the absence of self-existence [...] After sitting (in this manner) for a long time, the mind will become tame, and one will realize that his awareness is also discriminating mind [...] Awareness itself is without name or form [...] [T]he awareness and place where it occurs cannot be obtained by any search.

She is a three-time Olympic gold medallist, winning the 500 metres in 1980, the 1000 metres in 1984 and the 1500 metres in 1984. She won a total of eight Olympic medals.   ==Short biography== Karin Enke started her sport career as a figure skater at the club SC Einheit [[Dresden]]. Representing East Germany she came in ninth place at the [[European Figure Skating Championships]] in 1977. Later she changed to speed skating. Dominant on all distances (being reigning [[World Allround Speed Skating Championships|World Allround Champion]] and [[World Sprint Speed Skating Championships|World Sprint Champion]], and having won German Single Distance Championships titles on all five distances in 1983), Enke was the favourite for all four distances at the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] of [[Sarajevo]], but she won \"only\" two gold and two silver medals.<ref name=r1/> At the [[Speed Skating World Cup|World Cup]], Enke had 21 single-distance victories, but won only one overall World Cup. She retired from speed skating after the 1987–88 season.  Born as ''Karin Enke'', she married in 1981 and competed as ''Karin Busch'' during the 1981–82 winter. The marriage did not last long and during the 1982–83 and 1983–84 winters, she competed as ''Karin Enke'' again. After marrying her longtime former trainer Rudolf Kania in 1984, she competed as ''Karin Kania'' for the rest of her speed skating career. After her career had ended, she divorced and married again and became ''Karin Enke-Richter''.  Like several other female East German skaters who got married after the season had ended (and several of them more than once over the course of their careers), Enke caused some confusion among the speed skating public when she&mdash;a skater with a name unfamiliar to them&mdash;suddenly won major titles in her \"first\" season. Commentators were apt to make remarks like \"Karin Kania is the skater we knew as Karin Enke last season\" and some commentators even, half-jokingly, made remarks like \"I wonder what her name will be next season\". To alleviate the confusion, Enke kept her [[maiden name]] as the ''first'' part of her last name after her third marriage, just like [[Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann|Gunda Kleemann]] (also known as ''Gunda Niemann'' and ''Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann'') kept ''Niemann'' (the name of her first husband) as the ''first'' part of her last name even after her divorce and both before and after her second marriage, which is unusual in most Western European countries.  ==Doping use== On 3 January 2010, Giselher Spitzer, a German sport historian and researcher of the Humboldt University in Berlin, claimed in the Dutch TV documentary ''Andere Tijden'' ('Other Times') that back in 1984, Karin Enke had been prepared with doping. He based his claim on [[Stasi]]-documents, which were shown during the programme. Citation: \"[Dem Arzt] war bekannt, dass Karin ENKE zu den Olympischen  Spielen zu den ausgewählten Athleten gehörte, die mit erheblichen Mengen Testosteron und gleichzeitigen Gegenspritzen von Epitestosteron auf ihre Wettkämpfe vorbereitet würden.\" (\"It was known to the medic, that Karin ENKE at the Olympic Games belonged to those athletes who were prepared for the Games with relevant measures of Testosteron and, synchronously, with contrasting measures of Epitosteron.\").<ref>[http://www.sportweek.nl/schaatsen/123603/Raadsel_rondom_Van_Gennip_en_DDR-vrouwen_opgelost \"Raadsel rondom Van Gennip en DDR-vrouwen opgelost\"] Sportweek, 3 January 2010.</ref>  ==Medals== [[File:Karin Enke 1983.jpg|thumb|250px|Karin Enke at the European Championships in 1983]] An overview of medals won by Enke at important championships she participated in, listing the years in which she won each:  {| class=\"wikitable\" !

''Willmarth'' was laid down on 25 June 1943 at [[San Francisco, California]], by the [[Bethlehem Steel Company]]'s Shipbuilding Division; launched on 21 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Eva Willmarth, the mother of Ens. Willmarth; and commissioned on 13 March 1944, Lieutenant Commander James G. Thorburn, Jr., [[United States Naval Reserve|USNR]], in command.  ==Service history== ===To the Solomon Islands === Following shakedown out of [[San Diego]] and post-shakedown availability at her builder's yard, ''Willmarth'' was assigned to [[Escort Division 40]]. She stood out of [[San Francisco Bay]] on 31 May, as screen for the four-ship Convoy 2410 bound for [[Hawaii]], and arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] on 9 June.  On 12 June, together with {{USS|Donaldson|DE-44|3}} and {{USS|Reynolds|DE-42|3}}, ''Willmarth'' screened the sortie of the [[Marshall Islands]]-bound Convoy 4212-A. After delivering the [[convoy]] safely at [[Eniwetok]] nine days later, ''Willmarth'' proceeded on to the [[Treasury Islands]], anchoring in [[Blanche Harbor]] at 11:30 on the 26th.  Shifting successively to [[Tulagi]] and [[Purvis Bay]], ''Willmarth'' operated on local escort and patrol missions in the [[Solomon Islands|Solomon]] and [[Treasury Islands]] groups for the remainder of July. She escorted a small convoy to [[Dreger Harbor]], [[New Guinea]], between 1 and 5 August and then shifted to [[Milne Bay]] for repairs on her port propeller.  ===Challenging an unknown ship === Underway for the Treasury Islands on 24 August, ''Willmarth'' made radar contact with an unidentified ship at 02:00 on the 25th. ''Willmarth'' tracked the stranger and challenged her at 03:35, when about two miles (3&nbsp;km) distant. The latter did not reply, but instead altered course away from the destroyer escort and increased speed. ''Willmarth'' in turn churned up {{convert|18|kn|km/h}} and went to general quarters at 03:40.  ''Willmarth'' repeated the challenge at 04:06 but again received no reply. On the port beam of her target, the escort vessel illuminated the stranger with her searchlight and discovered her to be a freighter of some 8,000 to 10,000 tons. Only {{convert|2500|yd}} away, ''Willmarth's'' men could see the freighter's crew manning their guns to challenge the destroyer escort.  ''Willmarth'' opened the range to {{convert|4000|yd}} as the freighter responded with two different call signs, perhaps seeking to confuse the escort vessel. Just as ''Willmarth'' began to flash a call for recognition signals, the freighter commenced fire with {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} guns. The destroyer escort rang down for {{convert|20|kn|km/h}} and opened the range to {{convert|8000|yd}}, refraining from firing because of the stranger's appearance and location, \"indicating that it was friendly.\" With respect to the freighter's fierce — but fortunately ineffective — fire, ''Willmarth's'' war diarist noted charitably that the ship's \"range was excellent, but deflection was off.\" No shells landed closer than {{convert|1000|yd}} away.  ===Escort ship=== ''Willmarth'' subsequently anchored at Blanche Harbor later on the 25th. Late the next day, she got underway on an escort assignment and convoyed {{USS|Stratford|AP-41|3}} to [[Green Island, Papua New Guinea|Green Island]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], arriving on the 29th to screen the transport as she unloaded. She eventually escorted the troopship to Emirau Island and [[Torokina]], Bougainville, before proceeding independently to the Treasury Islands. She conducted training exercises over the balance of September before she performed local escort missions and the like out of her Treasury Islands' base into October.  ''Willmarth'' departed Blanche Harbor on 6 October in company with {{USS|Whitehurst|DE-634|3}}, bound for Dutch New Guinea. She arrived three days later and sortied on the 12th with Task Unit (TU) 77.7.1 which included {{USS|Ashtabula|AO-51|3}}, {{USS|Saranac|AO-74|3}}, {{USS|Chepachet|AO-78|3}}, {{USS|Salamonie|AO-26|3}}, {{USS|Mazama|AE-9|3}}, and merchant ship {{SS|Pueblo}}. Other escorts were {{USS|Witter|DE-636|3}}, {{USS|Bowers|DE-637|3}}, and ''Whitehurst''.  ''Willmarth'' operated with TU 77.7.1 until she was released late on the 13th to escort ''Chepachet'' and SS ''Pueblo'' to [[Kossol Passage]], in the Palaus. Arriving there at 18:21 on the 14th, she remained anchored for two days before beginning to patrol the harbor entrance on the 17th. Relieved of this duty by {{USS|Lovelace|DE-198|3}}, ''Willmarth'' got underway during the forenoon on 20 October to screen the sortie of ''Ashtabula'', ''Saranac'', ''Chepachet'', ''Salamonie'', ''Mazama'', and {{SS|Durham Victory}} for the [[Philippines]].  ===Philippines campaign=== ''Willmarth'' proceeded north with her convoy, while American troops splashed ashore on the beaches of [[Leyte]] to commence the [[Philippines campaign, 1944-45|liberation of the Philippines]]. On the 23rd, three days after the main landing began, the destroyer escort anchored off Leyte midway between the northern and southern transport areas while her oilers refueled the ships from Task Group (TG) 77.2. That evening, ''Willmarth'' steamed eastward toward a night anchorage and, at 18:25, observed [[anti-aircraft]] fire over the northern transport area.  Underway again off [[Homonhon Island]] early the next morning, the destroyer escort received a report of enemy [[aircraft]] orbiting over the northern transport area. As she steamed along the convoy's flank, she commenced making black smoke at 08:44 to lay a protective screen in anticipation of the enemy's arrival. While the radio crackled with reports of ships under attack, ''Willmarth'' spotted no enemy planes nearby, only many puffs of \"flak\" splattering the skies to the westward of her screening position in the refueling group.  With the receipt of a \"flash white\" at 13:43, the oilers resumed refueling TG 77.2. ''Willmarth'' shifted to [[Samar Island]] shortly before 17:00 before going to general quarters at 17:06 upon receipt of a \"flash red.\" After waiting for well over an hour for the enemy to make an appearance, the convoy stopped and prepared to anchor for the night.  At 18:43, however, three [[Nakajima B6N|\"Jills\"]] roared in low from the east, [[torpedo]]es slung menacingly beneath their bellies. ''Willmarth's'' guns opened fire on two just before they released their \"fish.\" One torpedo holed ''Ashtabula'' and forced her to a halt, dead in the water. While the oiler's repair parties controlled the flooding and patched the hole, the convoy passed out of [[Leyte Gulf]] and reformed in the wake of the attack. Eventually, ''Ashtabula'', repairs effected, rejoined at 22:30.  ''Willmarth'' and the convoy remained underway throughout the evening, maneuvering on various courses and speeds in Leyte Gulf until the first rays of sunlight streaked the eastern skies. After going to general quarters at 04:58, the destroyer escort remained at battle stations throughout the day. Less than an hour after her crew first closed up at action stations, two \"Jills\" attacked the convoy from the westward. ''Willmarth'' immediately opened fire with her {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} and {{convert|1.1|in|mm|sing=on}} batteries. As one \"Jill\" roared across the stern of the convoy, it was caught by gunfire from ''Willmarth'' and other ships of the convoy and crashed in flames far astern.  While maneuvering and making smoke to mask the convoy, the destroyer escort spotted a floating [[naval mine|mine]] which she sank with gunfire. Soon thereafter, another \"Jill\" passed through the area and drew fire from ''Willmarth''. Unfortunately, the shells were not observed to hit; and the plane escaped.  The convoy anchored in the fueling area at 11:52, three hours after the last attack. ''Willmarth'' and the other escorts screened the convoy and provided an [[anti-submarine]] screen patrol around the valuable auxiliaries. Later that afternoon, ''Willmarth'' repulsed an attack made by a lone plane which came out of the sun in a glide-bombing attack at 14:20. The destroyer escort's gunfire damaged the plane and caused it to spin into the water about five miles (8&nbsp;km) away.  The convoy departed the fueling area at 16:46. Frequent alerts and enemy planes enlivened the evening hours as the group maneuvered throughout the night in a retirement formation. ''Willmarth's'' war diarist noted that the [[Japan]]ese planes seemed loathe to attack ships in the fueling area during daylight, probably because of the heavy concentration of anti-aircraft fire that could be directed at an attacker.  The next day, 26 October, saw a repetition of the same routine that had kept the destroyer escort active since her arrival in Leyte Gulf three days earlier. After maneuvering on screening duties through the night, the warship spotted a lone [[Aichi D3A|\"Val\" dive bomber]] making an attack at 05:50; ''Willmarth'' opened fire from {{convert|6000|yd}} but failed to score any hits. Within minutes, she and her sister escorts were laying smoke screens to cover the convoy for the next hour. Thereafter, they provided anti-submarine screening protection while the oilers conducted fueling operations.  ===Further escort duty=== After following the same routine on the 27th, ''Willmarth'' departed Leyte Gulf and headed for the [[Palaus]]. At 08:00 on 28 October, ''Willmarth'' — escorting the oilers earmarked to refuel the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] ships — rendezvoused with the carriers of Task Group 77.4 and screened the refuelling operations for the balance of the day. Detached that afternoon, ''Willmarth'' screened ''Ashtabula'' and ''Chepachet'' as they voyaged to Kossol Roads, in the Palaus. Arriving on 31 October, ''Willmarth'' refueled from {{USS|Mascoma|AO-83|3}} and anchored, her job done.  The respite afforded the destroyer escort was a brief one, however, for she got underway on 1 November for [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] and [[Seeadler Harbor]], escorting a convoy. Entering [[Yos Sudarso Bay|Humboldt Bay]] on the 4th, ''Willmarth'' anchored there over the next two days before proceeding to sea to screen the sortie of TG 78.4 — {{HMS|Ariadne|M65|6}}, 12 [[Landing Ship Medium|LSM's]], 4 [[Landing Craft Infantry|LCI's]], 8 LCI(G)'s, {{USS|PC-1122||2}} and {{USS|PC-1133||2}} — on the 7th.  ===Western New Guinea campaign=== For the next three days, ''Willmarth'' screened the convoy to its destination — [[Mapia]] and [[Asia Islands]], near [[Morotai]] — before arriving in the invasion area on the 11th. As the convoy neared Morotai, ''Willmarth's'' lookouts observed anti-aircraft fire between 04:15 and 05:30. Two \"bogies\" passed within four miles (6&nbsp;km) of the convoy; but, as ''Wilmarth's'' war diarist recorded, \"evidently they either did not sight us or were not interested, as they proceeded directly toward the area from which flak appeared.\" There was a reason why ''Willmarth'' did not open fire on the two planes that seemed so close — she carried the only reliable air-warning radar in the entire convoy and to open fire prematurely would have disclosed the position of the little convoy and exposed it to possible air attacks. At 08:32, the destroyer escort anchored just off the southern coast of Morotai, near ''Ariadne'', while the remainder of the convoy (save the LCM's) proceeded to another part of the island to load for the impending invasion of Mapia and Asia Islands. The mission of the assault group was to establish weather station and [[LORAN]] — long range radio aid to navigation — facilities.  On 13 November, with the assault ships having embarked their troops, ''Willmarth'' got underway in company with TG 78.14, bound for [[Pegun Island]]. At 05:00, two days later — she was joined by {{USS|Shaw|DD-373|3}} and {{USS|Caldwell|DD-605|3}}. ''Willmarth'', the two destroyers, and ''PC-1122'' bombarded the southern part of the island prior to the landings and provoked no return fire from the beach. After a half-hour of firing, ''Ariadne'' signalled that \"H\" hour was 06:30, meaning that the first wave of [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT(A)s]] would hit the reef at that time.  ''Willmarth'' remained at her bombardment station for the rest of the morning, ceasing fire as the first assault wave splashed toward the beachhead. The accompanying LCI(G)'s laid their own barrage, thus obviating the need for the destroyers' gunfire. By noon, the island was in American hands. When surrounded, the remaining garrison — only 12 to 14 Japanese soldiers — committed suicide.  Meanwhile, since she was not needed for bombardment, ''Willmarth'' patrolled to the northward of the invasion beach and came across canoes full of natives to the north. One native, speaking good English, told ''Willmarth'' that the remainder of the Japanese garrison, about 170 men, had waded across the reef to [[Bras Island]] the previous night — thus accounting for the sparse reception given the invasion forces.  While plans were being laid to go after this remnant on Bras Island, ''Willmarth'' conducted anti-submarine patrol around the unloading assault craft and made abortive attempts to pull several LCI's that had been stranded by low tides off the reefs. At 17:30 on the 15th, the destroyer escort succeeded in towing one off after about an hour's time and began operations to free another one of the infantry assault craft. However, the destroyer escort's efforts were frustrated by the line's parting and the near approach of darkness.  Four LCI(G)'s had to be left on the reef — as was one LCI — when the task group headed for Morotai. Arriving on 17 November, ''Willmarth'' fueled from Salamonie before anchoring. Underway again on the 18th, with the Asia Island occupation force, ''Willmarth'' and two PC's served as escort for ''Ariadne'', four LCM's, four LCI's, and four LCI(G)'s. Embarked in the assault craft were 400 troops.  Three-fourths of a mile off [[Igi Island]], ''Willmarth'', ''Ariadne'', and ''PC-1122'' conducted shore bombardment from 05:42 to 06:19 on the 19th. Troops splashed ashore from landing craft eight minutes after the bombardment ceased and met no opposition. An unfortunate result of the shore bombardment was that two natives were wounded and one killed — the Japanese had evacuated the island in the face of imminent invasion the previous evening.  ''Willmarth'' subsequently screened the movement of the convoy to the [[Mapia Islands]], where the landing craft loaded troops and unloaded shore personnel and supplies. When the loading was completed at 18:00 on the 20th, the convoy shifted to Asia Island, where the destroyer escort screened the landing craft as they embarked more troops on the 21st. ''Willmarth'' continued her screening duties until arriving in the southernanchorage near the naval base at Morotai Island at 12:38 on 22 November. While there, the escort vessel witnessed an enemy night air raid on the airfield installations on Morotai. The Japanese boldly conducted their attacks despite anti-aircraft fire and searchlights. Local port restrictions forbade the use of any anti-aircraft batteries larger than 40 millimeter. ''Willmarth's'' war diary sadly noted this restriction, recommending that 3-inch gunfire could do very little damage to shore installations in the area.  While the rest of TG 78.14 departed Morotai on the 23rd, ''Willmarth'' remained behind as ''LSM-205'' and ''LSM-314'' loaded equipment for the Asia and Mapia Island forces. She then escorted those craft to Hollandia where they delivered their cargo. Over the next three days, ''Willmarth'' escorted the two landing craft on their appointed rounds, dropping off supplies at Asia and Mapia Islands. At one point, the arrival of the little convoy at Mapia on the 26th almost went unnoticed.  ''Willmarth'' experienced great difficulty contacting anyone on shore: \"We finally succeeded in rousing someone by blowing our siren and whistle together.\" A [[Willys MB|jeep]] soon appeared on the beach, its occupants using the headlights to signal. Heavier swells than at Asia Island made unloading through the surf difficult. One of the LSM's was holed several times by scraping on the jagged coral heads of the reef. When unloading was completed at 11:30, the diminutive convoy headed for Hollandia.  ===Service Squadron 4=== On 1 December 1944, ''Willmarth'' and the other ships from Escort Division 40 set sail for Manus, in the Admiralties, for assignment to [[Service Squadron 4]]. Arriving at Seeadler Harbor the following day, Willmarth spent the next three months operating on local escort missions between Manus, Ulithi, Hollandia, and the Palaus.  On 4 March 1945, ''Willmarth'' reported to the Commander, [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]], for duty. Between the 5th and 18th, she conducted anti-submarine patrols in the Palaus before being sent to Ulithi to refuel and replenish. She got underway again on the 21st to screen the sortie of TP 54 — the pre-invasion bombardment group — as it got underway for [[Okinawa]].  ===Okinawa campaign=== Assigned to screen TF 54, ''Willmarth'' operated with [[Naval gunfire support|Fire Support Unit]] 2 (TU 54.1.2) built around the [[battleship]] {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|3}}, in Fire Support (FS) areas 4 and 5, off Okinawa. The destroyer escort screened ''Colorado'' for the entire day on 26 March as the battleship delivered gunfire support for the troops ashore. Over the next two days, the warship screened fire support units and escorted them to night retirement areas. She was refuelled at Kerama Retto on the 30th before returning to screening duties with heavy units off the island.  On 1 April, she was steaming on station 16 of a circular screen around TU 54.3.2, a night retirement group built around the [[battleship]] {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|3}}, when several enemy planes flew near the convoy. Screening destroyers fired upon the intruders who probably did not come to attack the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] force but merely to keep it awake and permit it little rest.  Detached from this duty to provide a screen for {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|3}}, one of the oldest battleships on active service in the Navy, ''Willmarth'' operated to seaward as the battleship worked inshore to open fire on Japanese positions holding up the American advance near [[Naha Airport]]. After commencing this duty at 06:30, ''Willmarth'' had been serving on anti-submarine patrol for over six hours when Japanese [[shore battery]] guns boomed out salvoes at ''Arkansas''.  ''Arkansas{{'}}'' main battery trained 'round to reply and quickly commenced [[counter-battery fire]]. At the time of the initial firing, ''Willmarth'' was located about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) southwestward of the battleship, maintaining her screening position to seaward. At 13:23, a Japanese shell hurtled over ''Willmarth's'' bridge \"plainly heard\" by all men there. It splashed beyond the ship, {{convert|150|yd}} away. With only one boiler operating (the other had been secured to repair a leaking gasket) the destroyer escort was hampered in getting away, but she headed seaward at her best speed. Soon another shell landed only {{convert|15|yd}} beyond the destroyer escort's starboard quarter. While increasing the range, ''Willmarth'' turned toward each splash, thus avoiding getting hit by the Japanese guns. ''Arkansas'', by this time beyond gun range of the Nipponese guns, did not conduct any further counter-battery fire; Willmarth soon emerged from the enemy battery's zone of fire and proceeded to sea unscathed.  ===Attacked by Kamikaze=== After retiring to Kerama Retto soon thereafter for fueling, ''Willmarth'' operated on screening station A-27 until 6 April, when she returned to Kerama Retto with an [[appendicitis]] patient on board for medical treatment. Several bogies flew near the ship while she steamed to the fleet anchorage, and one was downed by a nearby ship at 02:00.  At 15:25, while still three miles (5&nbsp;km) north of Kerama Retto, ''Willmarth'' spotted three \"Val\" dive bombers. One peeled off and maneuvered to make an attack. Ten minutes later, it attempted to crash into the ship. Bracketed by flak, the \"Val\" bore in, apparently intent on crashing into the destroyer escort. Heavy {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} and {{convert|1.1|in|mm|sing=on}} fire bracketed the plane when she became visible, dodging in and out of the broken clouds overhead. Seven {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} bursts rocked the plane as she made her deadly approach. Lookouts on the destroyer escort noted a thin line of smoke tracking from the suicider's port wing as he went into his dive. The 20-millimeter battery on ''Wilmarth'' opened fire when the plane's range lessened to {{convert|2000|yd}}; and, at {{convert|800|yd}}, the Oerlikons seemed to have their effect. Pieces of the \"Val's\" wing began flying off in the slipstream, indicating that the shells were beginning to hit. Six feet of the port wing soon broke away, shot off by the flak, and the \"Val\" spun into the sea {{convert|20|yd}} off the ship's port side, slightly abaft her beam.  ''Willmarth'' entered Kerama Retto at 16:10; and, while preparing to anchor, saw {{USS|LST-447||2}} hit by a suicide plane south of the harbor entrance. Flames had engulfed the entire amidships section of the stricken landing ship, and explosions tore holes in the stricken ship's side. The jagged edges in turn ripped gashes in ''Willmarth's'' hull at the waterline. One hole, unfortunately, opened up one of the destroyer escort's fuel tanks, and the oil leaking out made further close operations hazardous.  ''Willmarth'' stood clear while dense smoke from the burning LST further complicated firefighting. Eventually, the destroyer escort picked up the ship's survivors and later transferred them to  {{USS|Crescent City|APA-21|3}}. While steaming to the ship's anchorage in the harbor, she took an enemy plane under fire as it approached from the south; and multiple gunfire from all ships present in the habor knocked it down.  ''Willmarth'' anchored, transferred her appendicitis patient ashore, and patched the hole in her side caused by the damaged ''LST-447'' before proceeding on the 7th to screening station \"Able-60\" near the transport area off the west coast of Okinawa. Following her shift to another screening station on the morning of the 8th, ''Willmarth'' escorted {{USS|Saranac|AO-74|3}} to Kerama Retto on the 9th. On 10 April, the destroyer escort departed the Okinawa area, bound for [[Guam]] in the screen for 12 transports.  ===Screening 3rd Fleet logistics force === Arriving at Guam on the 14th, ''Willmarth'' developed boiler trouble while there and spent the entire month of May and most of June undergoing repairs. On 28 June, the destroyer escort got underway for Ulithi. En route, she picked up a sonar contact, and in company with {{USS|Trippe|DD-403|3}}, over the ensuing two days, conducted an unsuccessful hunt. ''Willmarth'' then proceeded on to Ulithi where she arrived on the last day of June.  Underway again on 3 July, ''Willmarth'' stood out of Ulithi lagoon screening the logistics force of the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]] which would provide the needed supplies for Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.|William F. Halsey]]'s [[fast carrier task force]]s as it pounded the Japanese homeland. During the passage north, the destroyer escort planeguarded for {{USS|Steamer Bay|CVE-87|3}} and conducted anti-submarine screening operations. She picked up the crew of a downed [[TBF Avenger]] on 20 July. On that occasion, two swimmers from ''Willmarth'' helped to get the downed airmen on board. However, one of the crewmen died. The two survivors and the body of the dead man were transferred to ''Steamer Bay'' later that day.  ''Willmarth'' subsequently planeguarded for {{USS|Gilbert Islands|CVE-107|3}} in early August, continuing her screening and escort duties with TG-30 — the replenishment group for the 3rd Fleet. She was at sea when the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs were dropped upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] on 6 and 9 August, respectively, and when [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered on the 15th]].  ===Post-war activities=== ''Willmarth'' remained on escort duty off the coast of Japan into September. In mid-September, the ship underwent an availability in [[Tokyo Bay]] and rode out a storm there on 18 September. Departing Tokyo Bay on 24 September to return to the United States, ''Willmarth'' touched at Pearl Harbor, San Diego, and the [[Panama Canal]] before undergoing an overhaul at [[Norfolk, Virginia]] which lasted until late in October.  ===Decommissioning and disposal=== Shifting to the [[St. Johns River]], [[Florida]], soon thereafter, ''Willmarth'' prepared for inactivation with the Florida group of the 16th (Reserve) Fleet. Berthed in the [[Green Cove Springs]] facility, ''Willmarth'' was decommissioned on 26 April 1946 and placed in reserve. She remained there until struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 1 December 1966. Sold on 1 July 1968 to the [[North American Smelting Company]], of [[Wilmington, Delaware]], the ship was broken up for scrap soon thereafter.  ==Awards== ''Willmarth'' received four [[battle star]]s for her participation in [[World War II]].  ==References== *{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w9/willmarth.htm|http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/escorts/de638.txt}}  ==External links== * {{navsource|06/638|USS Willmarth}}   {{Buckley class destroyer escort}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Willmarth (DE-638)}} [[Category:Buckley-class destroyer escorts]] [[Category:Ships built in San Francisco, California]] [[Category:1943 ships]] [[Category:World War II frigates and destroyer escorts of the United States]]"],["Manitoba Highway 32",3343252,674171874,"2015-08-02T04:27:04.000+0000","SporkBot",12406635,"{{Refimprove|date=August 2013}} {{Infobox road |province=MB |type=Hwy |route=32 |alternate_name= |map= |length_km= 23 |direction_a=South |terminus_a={{jct|state=ND|SR|32}} ([[Canada – United States border]]) |direction_b=North |terminus_b={{jct|state=MB|PTH|14|PR|428}} near [[Winkler, Manitoba|Winkler]] |towns=[[Winkler, Manitoba|Winkler]] |established=1957 |previous_type=Hwy |previous_route=31 |next_type=Hwy |next_route=34 }} '''Provincial Trunk Highway 32''' ('''PTH 32''') is a provincial highway in the [[Canadian]] province of [[Manitoba]].

It became an immediate bestseller in Turkey, with several hundred thousand copies sold as of 2006.  The book gained international attention mainly because of its plot about a war between Turkey and the United States (who are [[NATO]] allies) and because of its enthusiastic reception in Turkey. According to the Turkish newspaper ''[[Radikal gazetesi|Radikal]]'', \"the Foreign Ministry and General Staff are reading it keenly\" and \"all cabinet members also have it\".  The book's plot and reception is thought by most observers to reflect an increasing level of [[Anti-Americanism]] in the wake of the [[War on Terror]], the [[Iraq War]] and especially the \"[[hood event|2003 Hood Event]]\" that was perceived as a national humiliation in Turkey.  The U.S. government in the novel is led by a nameless [[President of the United States|president]] reminiscent of [[George W. Bush]] and portrayed as an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] zealot. It also includes real-life U.S. Cabinet members [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. The novel also features then-current real-life political leaders at the helm of their respective nations. ==Plot== In 2007, the [[United States]] invades [[Turkey]] to gain control of its deposits of an important strategic resource, [[borax]]. After securing the principal cities in Turkey, the United States attempts to re-enact the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] by dividing Turkey up between its historic rivals [[Greece]] and [[Armenia]]. Turkey responds by forming a military alliance with [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Germany]]. A Turkish agent then steals an American nuclear bomb and detonates it in [[Washington, D.C.]], killing millions of people. This however, backfires and U.S. troops increase their abuse of occupied Turkish citizens and the invasion picks up in pace. When American troops reach Istanbul, the conflict degrades to urban combat between U.S. forces, Turkish armed citizenry, Turkish Army remnants and police forces. The climax turns out to be anticlimactic; the occupation of Istanbul agitates Russia, the [[European Union]] and China to sign a military alliance and threaten the United States with nuclear warfare in order to stop the invasion. The war comes to a close; U.S. forces retreat, and Turkey is saved. The agent, a member of a secret Turkish intelligence agency named \"The Grey Team\", trained from birth as obedient and amoral orphans, kidnaps the mastermind behind the invasion, the CEO of a corporation funding the U.S. President, and the book ends with a Central Asian torture scene with said CEO.  == See also == * [[Turkey-United States relations]] * ''[[Valley of the Wolves Iraq]]'', a 2006 Turkish film also featuring a Turkish-U.S. conflict  == References == * {{cite news | first = | last = | author = Ted Widmer | coauthors = | title = Death to the Crusade | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140531063105/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/books/review/18widmer.html| work = | publisher = [[New York Times]] | pages = | page = | date = September 18, 2005 | accessdate = May 31, 2014| language = }} * {{cite news | first = | last = | author = Soli Özel | coauthors = | title = The Gathering Storm | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100212033933/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2005/07/01/the_gathering_storm | format = | work = | publisher = [[Foreign Policy]] | pages = | page = | date = July–August 2005 | accessdate = February 12, 2010| language = }} * {{cite news | first = | last = | author = Yigal Schleifer | coauthors = | title = Sure it's fiction.

[[Hundred (division)|Hundred]]s were once used as a basis for representation in the [[Delaware General Assembly]], and while their names still appear on all real estate transactions, they presently have no meaningful use or purpose except as a geographical point of reference.  ==Boundaries and formation==  White Clay Creek Hundred is that portion of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] that lies north of the [[Christiana River]] and south and west of [[White Clay Creek]], excepting that it also includes the small area west of the [[Christiana River]] immediately west of [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], and excludes a larger area north and east of the [[Christiana River]] generally from the old [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] tracks to Cooch’s Bridge.  It was formed from [[Christiana Hundred]] and [[New Castle Hundred]] in 1710 and was named for [[White Clay Creek]] that flows along its northern boundary.    Originally, the default boundary of [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] was the vague height of land between the [[Delaware River]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]] drainage basins and White Clay Creek Hundred extended to that point.  With the running of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] in 1767, the western boundary of [[Delaware]] was established in its present location and became White Clay Creek Hundred’s western boundary.  It was the gap between this line and the existing western boundary, the [[The Twelve-Mile Circle|12 mile arc]] drawn around the town of [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], which created the long-disputed area known as [[The Wedge (border)|the Wedge]].  ==Development==  Except for some preserved woods along [[White Clay Creek]], this area is now completely urban and suburban with continuous industrial, commercial and residential developments, much of it in the small city of [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], the location of the [[University of Delaware]].  The greater part of the city of [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], and the community of Christiana are in White Clay Creek Hundred, as is the area around [[Christiana Mall]].  ==Geography==  The important geographical features of the hundred are the [[Christiana River]] and [[White Clay Creek]].  It is mostly in the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain|coastal plain]] region with a small portion north and west of [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]] in the [[piedmont (United States)|piedmont]] above the [[fall line]].    ==Transportation==  Important roads include portions of [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|Interstate 95]], the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway ([[Delaware Route 1]]), New London Road ([[Delaware Route 896]]), Elkton Road, the Kirkwood Highway ([[Delaware Route 2]]), Ogletown-Stanton Road ([[Delaware Route 4]]), Christiana Road ([[Delaware Route 273]]), and the old main highway between Wilmington and Baltimore, now Christiana-Stanton Road ([[Delaware Route 7]]) and [[Old Baltimore Pike]].  A portion of the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]], subsequently the main north-south line of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], now [[Amtrak]], crosses through [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], as does a portion of the old [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], now [[CSX Transportation]].

It protects diverse coastal habitat, including part of the 220&nbsp;km² [[Iguéla Lagoon]], the only significant example of a typical western [[Africa]]n [[lagoon]] system that is protected within a national park.  Situated between the [[Nkomi]] and [[Ndogo Lagoon]]s, Loango National Park is the true jewel of Africa's western coast. The naturalist [[J. Michael Fay|Mike Fay]] called Loango 'Africa's Last Eden' and this is where Michael \"Nick\" Nichols from [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] took his well-known pictures of surfing hippos. Both men call Loango the 'Land of surfing hippos'. The park’s 1,550&nbsp;km² of savanna, pristine beach, forest and mangroves are a must-see in Gabon. Loango National Park offers breathtaking panoramas and the unique opportunity to observe elephants, buffalos, hippos, gorillas and leopards venturing onto the white sand beaches.  After South Africa, the world’s largest concentration and variety of whales and dolphins can be found right off the Loango coast. The area has over 100 kilometres of uninhabited coastline and [[humpback whale|humpback]] and [[killer whale]]s are easy to observe here. This is arguably the most beautiful spot on Africa's western coast – the place where forests, savannas, wetlands, lagoons and ocean all come together. Loango is renowned worldwide as a site for tarpon of record size, as well as many other large saltwater fish.  The [[World Conservation Union]] or International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), an international organization dedicated to natural resource conservation, classed Loango National Park as a faunal reserve and protected area for conservation.  ==The history of Loango National Park== In 1956 the first regional faunal reserves were created in and around Loango National Park to promote sustainable use of the area’s wildlife and wild lands. In November 2002, President [[Omar Bongo Ondimba]] put Gabon firmly on the map by creating 13 new national parks in Gabon. All together, the thirteen parks created represent 10% of the landmass of Gabon. One of the more spectacular parks in this system is Loango National Park. Very few villages currently exist within the park, as most are located on the opposite bank of the Ngove Lagoon. As such, the park is nearly devoid of people and home only to a vast and spectacular array of terrestrial, avian and marine wildlife. While some of these animals inhabit specific ecological niches to which they have been adapting over time immemorial, others such as elephants and buffalos range across a number of landscapes. Many of the animals can be encountered by visitors on foot, in a vehicle, or seen from a blind.  ==Tourism and conservation go hand in hand in Loango National Park== Rombout Swanborn, a pioneering Dutch investor in ‘Conservation Tourism’ developed ''SCD'' (''Société de Conservation de Developpement''). Research, park management and educational activities are performed in partnership with WCS. Also, he created ''Africa’s Eden'', developing the infrastructure and logistics to provide high-end nature tourism experiences in remote parts of Gabon (and from 2006 in [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] as well) based on the concept \"Tourism pays for Conservation\".  ==The people of Loango National Park== Like most peoples around the globe, the human inhabitants of the Loango area remain dependent on the natural resources that surround them for their daily needs. Today, although some Gabonese citizens have migrated toward the urban centres or taken up employment within modern industries, such as oil and timber production, most individuals living in traditional villages still depend heavily upon their natural surroundings for their day-to-day needs.  Village-dwelling peoples use a slash-and-burn agricultural technique and grow a number of domesticated plant species including manioc, peanuts, and mustard greens. Women are responsible for most of the gardening, save for the preliminary felling and clearing of trees and brush. Men make their living by [[fishing]] or [[hunting]]. [[Fishermen]] use long nets, [[Cast net|throw nets]], [[Gillnet|gill nets]], [[Longline fishing|long line]]s, [[Fishing bait|baited]] [[Fish hook|hooks]], [[fish trap]]s and [[Spearfishing|spears]] to catch [[fish]] and [[shrimp]]. [[Land crab]]s are caught by hand. Traditional hunting gear such as bows and arrows, spears, deadfall and spring traps, have been replaced by high-calibre rifles and shotguns. A number of other food products are harvested wild in the forest or savannah or from the beaches, such as turtle eggs.  ==Loango National Park Images== <gallery> Image:Gabon Loango National Park Elephant with GPS tracker fitted.jpeg|Elephant with GPS collar, Loango National Park Image:Gabon Loango National Park Elephant with offspring.jpeg|Elephant with offspring roaming Image:Gabon Loango National Park Southern Camping Ground bar with a view.jpeg|Southern Park Camp Site bar with a view Image:Gabon Loango National Park Wild Buffalo Single.jpeg|Single Wild Buffalo within the park roaming </gallery>  [[File:Gabon Loango National Park Southern Camping Ground Panoramic.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=2.5|Southern Park Camping Ground looking towards Ocean]] [[File:Gabon Loango National Park View of Lodge from water.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=2.5|View of lodge from water]] {{clear}}  == External links == * [http://www.wcs.org/international/Africa/gabon/loango Wildlife Conservation Society] *[http://www.gabon-nature.com/ Virtual Tour of the National Parks] * {{Wikivoyage-inline}}  {{National Parks of Gabon}}  [[Category:National parks of Gabon]] [[Category:Protected areas established in 2002]] [[Category:2002 establishments in Gabon]]"],["Daniel T.

He was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] and practiced in [[Bangor, Maine]]; he was city solicitor from 1834 to 1837. From 1850 to 1853 he engaged with his brother in operating a [[steamboat]] line upon the [[Chagres River]], [[Isthmus of Panama]]. He moved to California and engaged in [[gold mining]] for two years, after which he returned to Bangor and practiced law.  In 1857 he moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and continued the practice of law; in 1866 he was a member of the [[Missouri House of Representatives]]. Jewett was appointed as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of [[Charles D.

As its name suggests, the channel is a commercial service that primarily broadcasts films.  ==History== In November 2000, [[Canwest]], through its subsidiary Global Television Network Inc., was granted approval by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) to launch a television channel called ''Adventure'', described as \"a national English-language Category 2 specialty television service devoted to action and adventure programming. Its program schedule will run the gamut from contemporary \"popcorn\" action and adventure films and series, to classical westerns, rodeo and western horse shows.\"<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-571.htm Decision CRTC 2000-571] CRTC 2000-12-14</ref>   The channel was launched under the name '''Lonestar''' on September 7, 2001, focusing exclusively on Western and rural-themed programming such as films, television dramas, and lifestyle series. After a few years, Lonestar began to air more general action and adventure programming unrelated to the Western theme of its early years, a considerable amount of that being movies, to the point where they made up the majority of the schedule.  On August 21, 2008, Canwest announced that Lonestar would be rebranded as '''MovieTime''', focusing on contemporary films. The name change took effect on October 6, 2008.<ref>Hank, Melissa.

The {{Convert|43|acre|sing=on}} is situated northwest of the [[Brown County Reforestation Camp]], {{convert|11|mi|km}}, which together cover {{convert|1560|acre|km2}} and have over a half million visitors each year.  The NEW Zoo does not receive local or regional tax support for its annual operating budget.<ref name=\"zoo_about\"/>  == History == {{One source|section|date=December 2014}} The area where the zoo is located was covered with pine and oak forests when European settlers began arriving in the 1800s.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/> Intensive lumbering soon cleared most of the land and residents began planting crops. Once the forests were gone, there were no leaves or logs left to decompose and replenish the sandy soil and the soil was no longer able to produce crops. In the late 1800s, [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]] acquired the {{convert|1600|acre|km2|adj=on}} area that makes up the Reforestation Camp.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/>  In 1948, sparks from a passing train set fire to {{convert|80|acre}} of county land and destroyed what was left of the forest. This prompted the County Board to build an open prison camp and plant trees, hence the name Brown County Reforestation Camp. Beginning in 1950, Harry Barth, the first camp superintendent, and his wife directed inmates in planting 250,000 white pine, Norway pine, Jack pine, cedar, and spruce seedlings.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/> This continued for several years until the sandy wasteland was once again green forest.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/>  During the 1950s, the reforestation camp became part of the county park system. Ponds were dug for fire protection and recreation and fish were stocked. Hiking and ski trails were established. By 1952, bear, deer and timber-wolves were exhibited at the park and the zoo was established.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/>  In 1985, the county board decided to cease providing funds for capital improvements at the zoo. Since then, all new animal exhibits and major improvements have been financed by the NEW Zoological Society, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, and by private donations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newzoo.org/zoological-society/|title=Zoological Society|work=newzoo.org|publisher=Northeast Wisconsin Zoo|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref>  The most recent addition to the zoo, the Adventure Park, includes dual \"racing\" zip lines, an aerial adventure course, and a climbing tower.<ref name=\"zoo_adventure\"/> The park was built to appear minimally invasive and naturally appealing.<ref name=\"zoo_adventure\"/> For example, the historic fire tower, built in 1955, is now the starting point for the dual \"racing\" zip lines.<ref name=\"zoo_adventure\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://whoonew.com/2014/05/discover-the-new-zoo-adventure-park-an-adrenaline-rush-thats-close-to-home/ |title=Discover the NEW Zoo Adventure Park-An Adrenaline Rush That's Close to Home |work=whoonew.com |publisher=Ashley Steinbrinck |accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>  == Exhibits == Many types of native plants and animals can be found at the zoo, which features more than 92 exhibits with more than 215 animals from around the world.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/>  === Penguin exhibit === Located near the main entrance of the zoo, the penguin exhibit is home to both the [[African penguin]] and the [[South African shelduck]].<ref name=\"zoo_about\"/> In the spring of 2013, the [[Species Survival Plan]] allowed two of the zoo's penguins to breed and visitors could view the baby penguin later that fall.

Roland''' (September 15, 1921 in [[Dallas]] &ndash; August 11, 1982 in [[New York]]) was a [[jazz]] [[composer]] and [[musician]] who played many instruments during his career but was most significant as an arranger/composer and for his association with [[Stan Kenton]]. Roland was the only arranger to write for Kenton in all four decades of the band's existence.<ref>Michael Sparke, ''Stan Kenton&nbsp;– This Is an Orchestra!'', excerpt from one of the photo pages between pps 142 & 143, University of North Texas Press (2010)</ref>  ==Life and work== Roland, who gained a degree in music from the [[University of North Texas College of Music]], first met up with Kenton in 1944, playing fifth [[trumpet]] and contributing arrangements. He worked briefly with [[Lionel Hampton]] and [[Lucky Millinder]] and then rejoined Kenton in 1945, this time as a [[trombonist]] and writer (he arranged the hit \"Tampico\").  Roland played [[piano]] and wrote for a group in 1946 that included [[Stan Getz]], [[Zoot Sims]], [[Jimmy Giuffre]] and [[Herbie Steward]] and would lead to [[Woody Herman]]'s Four Brothers Second Herd. In the late 1940s, Roland played trombone with [[Georgie Auld]], trumpet with [[Count Basie]], [[Charlie Barnet]] and Lucky Millinder and contributed charts for the big bands of [[Claude Thornhill]] and [[Artie Shaw]]. After leading a giant rehearsal band in 1950 that included [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charlie Parker]], Roland wrote for Kenton in 1951, [[Dan Terry]] in 1954, and Woody Herman from 1956–58, for whom he contributed 65 arrangements. Roland was a major force in Kenton's [[mellophonium]] band of the early 1960s, not only writing for the ensemble but performing as one of the [[mellophoniums]]; he also occasionally doubled on soprano sax with the orchestra.  Gene Roland provided the robust vocal on \"Hawaiian Teenage Girl\" (composed by Bob Bertram), issued on a 49th State Record Company as 45 rpm record HRC-314A.  Roland remained active as a writer in the 1960s and 70s, working with the Radiohus Orchestra in [[Copenhagen]] (1967) and contributing charts to Kenton as well as Dan Terry's D.T.B.B.B. album (Metronome Records, 1981); he also played trumpet, piano and tenor with his own groups. In addition to writing an entire album for Kenton, Roland led his 1950 rehearsal band on a [[Spotlite Records|Spotlite]] release ([[Charlie Parker|Parker]] is one of his sidemen), led half of an album (recorded in 1957 and 1959) for [[Dawn Records]] in which he plays trumpet, and arranged a 1963 octet record for [[Brunswick Records]].  == References == {{reflist|2}}  == External links == * [http://home.comcast.net/~nwedder/roland2page.htm Gene Roland ''A Composer/Arranger For All The Right Reasons and Seasons''] * [http://www.honors.umd.edu/HONR269J/projects/boyd.html Stan Kenton: Progressive Concepts in Jazz] * [http://www.middlehornleader.com/Kenton%20Mellophoniums.htm Stan Kenton's Mellophonium Band] *[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/RR/frodd.html Biography in Handbook of Texas]  {{Authority control}}  {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME              = Roland, Gene | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = American composer | DATE OF BIRTH     = September 15, 1921 | PLACE OF BIRTH    = | DATE OF DEATH     = August 11, 1982 | PLACE OF DEATH    = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Roland, Gene}} [[Category:American jazz composers]] [[Category:American music arrangers]] [[Category:1921 births]] [[Category:1982 deaths]] [[Category:People from Dallas, Texas]] [[Category:University of North Texas alumni]] [[Category:20th-century composers]] [[Category:20th-century American musicians]]"],["Juliet O'Neill",7009414,672322994,"2015-07-20T20:31:11.000+0000","Egsan Bacon",603343,"'''Juliet O'Neill ''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] journalist who was the subject of controversy when the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] raided her house in 2004 in an attempt to find the source of an alleged internal leak giving her access to privileged documents related to the [[Maher Arar]] case.  ==Career== In 1986, O'Neill was working for the [[Canadian Press]] newswire, when she caught international attention for being the only reporter to capture [[Sondra Gotlieb]] slapping her social [[secretary]] Connie Gibson Connor at a [[state dinner]] held to honour Canadian Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] and US Vice President [[George H.

Her mother, Ortencia, worked in a tire factory.<ref name=\"Biography Today\">{{cite book |last=|first=|title=Biography Today|year=2009|page=21|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=[[Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-7808-1052-5}}</ref> She was raised in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]], [[Los Angeles]] (a predominately African-American and Mexican-American neighborhood), in an all-female household composed of her mother, her aunts Rita and Delia, and her grandmother Francisca.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.22\">\"Biography Today\", pp.22</ref> Her grandmother was an herbal healer and practiced [[Curandero|curanderismo]],<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.22\"/> which profoundly influenced her sense of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Chicano]] culture.  Baca's mother later married Clarence Ferrari in 1952, and Baca has a half-brother Gary and half-sister Diane.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.21</ref> Afterward the three of them moved to [[Pacoima, Los Angeles]]. This neighborhood was drastically different from Watts – Mexican-Americans were minorities in Pacoima.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.22\"/>  ===Education=== Baca was not allowed to speak Spanish in elementary school, as it was prohibited, and did not know English very well. Her teacher would tell her to go paint in the corner while the others studied. It took some time, but Baca started getting better in classes once she was able to understand the textbooks. With the encouragement of her art teacher she began drawing and painting. She later graduated from [[Bishop Alemany High School]] in 1964.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.22\"/>  She then attended [[California State University, Northridge]] (CSUN) and earned her Bachelor's degree in 1969 and Master's degree in art in 1979. While there, she learned and studied [[Abstract art|modern abstract art]]. She wanted to make art that was accessible beyond the constraints of the gallery and the museum. She wanted to make art for the people she loved, but she knew that they didn't go to galleries. \"I thought to myself, if I get my work into galleries, who will go there? People in my family hadn't ever been in a gallery in their entire lives. My neighbors never went to galleries...And it didn't make sense to me at the time to put art behind some guarded wall.\"<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.23</ref>  After completing graduate school, Baca continued her education, studying muralism at Taller [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|Siqueiros]] in [[Cuernavaca, Mexico]].  ===Teacher and other jobs=== When she graduated from CSUN she got a job teaching at her former high school. Her students were not very friendly with each other, and she thought she had an idea about how to teach them to cooperate with each other. She had a group of her students make a mural on one side of the school's wall. Everybody wanted to work on it, and it encouraged them to work things out without fighting. Baca was present at the 1970 [[Chicano Moratorium]], an [[anti-war]] action of the [[Chicano Movement]]. The principal of the school believed teachers should not take part in the protest marches, and she was fired with several other teachers.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.25</ref>  After being fired, she thought she could never get another job because of her involvement in the protests. She would find her next job at the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department. Her new job was teaching art for a summer program in the city's public parks. At that time [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles]] had the most Mexican-Americans and the highest number of gangs in the country. Members of different gangs loitered in the parks she worked at, and she noticed the graffiti and knew they were territorial markings. \"You could read a wall and learn everything you needed to know about that community.\" One of her favorites was, \"I'd rather spend one day as a lion than a hundred as a lamb.\"<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.25-26</ref>  ===''Las Vistas Nuevas''=== In the summer of 1970, Baca decided to create a mural in Boyle Heights in order to bring community together. In the first team she had twenty members from four different gangs, and the group decided on the name ''Las Vistas Nuevas'' (\"New Views\"). The mural they would create would show images that would be familiar to the Mexican-Americans who were living in the neighborhood. \"I want to use public space to create a public voice for, and a public consciousness about people who are, in fact, the majority of the population but who are not represented in any visual way.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.26</ref>  ====''Mi Abuelita''==== Their first project was on three walls of an outdoor stage in [[Hollenbeck Park]]. ''Mi Abuelita'' (\"My Grandmother\") was a mural that depicted a Mexican-American grandmother with her arms outstretched as if to give a hug. \"This work recognized the primary position of the matriarch in Mexican families. It also marked the first step in the development of a unique collective process that employs art to mediate between rival gang members competing for public space and public identity.\" <ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.26-27\">\"Biography Today\", pp.26-27</ref>  Local police did not like the idea of rival gang members working together, fearing it would spark gang violence. Baca also began to work on the mural without permission from the city or the manager of Hollenbeck Park, which engendered questions from her supervisor and other city officials.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.27</ref>  Despite all these troubles, Baca wanted to finish the project. She had lookouts who would signal the mural team if rival gang members were headed toward the work site, or if the police were coming. One day a city official came to the park because he had been getting complaints about the project. After seeing the progress done and team members working so well with each other, he gave Baca permission from the city to complete the mural. \"The city was amazed at the work I was doing, making murals with kids who scared directors out of neighborhood centers.\"<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.28\">\"Biography Today\", pp.28</ref>  After its completion, the community loved ''Mi Abuelita''. Baca said, \"Everybody related to it. People brought candles to that site. For 12 years people put flowers at the base of the grandmother image.\" ''Las Vistas Nuevas'' would complete a total of three murals that summer.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.28\"/>  After the murals she was offered a job in 1970 as the director of a new citywide mural program. She was in charge of creating this program from the ground up, which included choosing where murals would go, designing the murals, and supervising the mural painting teams, which would consist of teenagers who were in trouble with the police. Members of the original ''Las Vistas Nuevas'' group were hired to help run Baca's multi-site program. This group would go on to paint more than 500 murals.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.28\"/>  In this new job she encountered her first problems with [[censorship]]. People in neighborhoods where murals were being created wanted to show all parts of life in their neighborhood, both the good and bad. The city, however, did not want any controversial subjects depicted in these murals. In one case, when the city objected to a mural that showed people struggling with police, they threatened to stop funding the program if Baca did not remove it. Baca said, \"I really liked the idea that the work could not be owned by anyone. So, therefore it wasn't going to be interesting to the rich or to the wealthy, and it didn't have to meet the caveats of art that museums would be interested in. Rather than give in , she formed the [[Social and Public Art Resource Center]] (SPARC) in 1976 to continue funding the creation of murals in public.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.28-29</ref>  Baca’s efforts to include community in her artistic processes make her unique to her time. Bringing youth together to create art left a lasting impression in Los Angeles, shifting Chicano/a culture. The involvement of poor youth of color in Baca’s artistic processes changed the way white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchal culture perceived their place in society. Perhaps even more importantly, Baca’s Citywide Mural Program strengthened community and gave people a sense of purpose.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Raising Community Consciousness with Public Art: Contrasting Projects by Judy Baca and Andrew Leicester on JSTOR|url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/3109047?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=judy&searchText=baca&searchUri=%25252Faction%25252FdoBasicResults%25253FQuery%25253Djudy%25252Bbaca%252526amp%25253Bacc%25253Don%252526amp%25253Bwc%25253Don%252526amp%25253Bfc%25253Doff%252526amp%25253Bgroup%25253Dnone%252526amp%25253Bvf%25253Djo&seq=6#page_scan_tab_contents|website = www.jstor.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04|last = Doss|first = Erika}}</ref>  '''Feminism and Art'''  On many levels, Judy Baca’s art is feminist. Baca moved community in a way that is feminist and intersectional. As a Chicana woman, she wanted to empower women of color and bring community together in Los Angeles. Baca did so by illuminating the beauty and power enriched in Chicana culture through public art. The processes behind the images that Baca created are equally powerful—Baca’s premise in her artistic process was to involve disempowered youth in order to evoke a sense of community and enable growth. In some ways, these acts cause Baca’s art to be feminist. On the other hand, identity is personal, and only Baca has the agency to identify herself and her art as feminist.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Stepping out of the Beaten Path: Reassessing the Feminist Art Movement on JSTOR|url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/521062?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=judy&searchText=baca&searchText=feminist&searchUri=%25252Faction%25252FdoBasicSearch%25253FQuery%25253Djudy%25252Bbaca%25252Bfeminist%252526amp%25253Bacc%25253Don%252526amp%25253Bwc%25253Don%252526amp%25253Bfc%25253Doff%252526amp%25253Bgroup%25253Dnone|website = www.jstor.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04|last = Brodsky|first = Judith K.|authorlink = |last2 = Olin|first2 = Ferris}}</ref>  ==SPARC==  ===''Great Wall of Los Angeles''=== Their first project was the ''[[Great Wall of Los Angeles]]''. She was hired by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] to help improve the area around a [[San Fernando Valley]] flood control channel called the [[Tujunga Wash]]. It's essentially a ditch that contained a large concrete retaining wall. Her idea for a mural was to paint a history of the city of [[Los Angeles]], but not the version found in history books. The events that were overlooked were the ones that interested her. \"It was an excellent place to bring youth of varied ethnic backgrounds from all over the city to work on an alternate view of the history of the U.S. which included people of color who had been left out of American history books.\" Baca also said the defining metaphor of the mural would be that \"It is a tattoo on the scar where the river once ran.\"<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.29-30</ref>  Baca was inspired by ''Los tres Grandes'' (\"The Three Greats\"), a novel about three of the most influential Mexican muralists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[José Clemente Orozco]]. In 1977 she attended a workshop at the Taller Siqueiros in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]], to learn muralism techniques and see their murals in person. Even though all three were deceased by that time, she was able to work with some of Siqueiros' former students.  When she returned and began this project, Baca made the explicit decision to involve people from the community that represented voices that have been historically marginalized. At the beginning of the muraling project in 1976, Baca began work alongside 80 young people who had been referred to the program by the criminal justice department.<ref name=\"sparcinla.org\">{{Cite web|title = The Great Wall – History and Description - SPARCinLA|url = http://sparcinla.org/the-great-wall-part-2/|website = sparcinla.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}</ref> For Baca, this marling project was about more than just painting a mural, but rather about investing in the community in ways that had not been done before. Baca took the lead on the project by interviewing people about their lives, family histories, ancestry, and stories they remembered hearing from their older relatives, as well as consulting history experts. From this, she was able to create the design for the mural. Some of the events portrayed in the mural constituted the first time they had ever been displayed in public, including but not limited to the [[Dust Bowl]] Journey, [[Japanese American internment]] during [[World War II]], [[Zoot Suit Riots]], and the [[Freedom Rides|Freedom Bus Rides]].<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.30-31</ref>  Baca wanted the project to be done by people who were as diverse as those to be painted. Baca states that “I draw on skills not normally used by artists. I’ve learned as much as I’ve taught from the youth I’ve had the good fortune to know by working alongside of them”.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Great Wall of Los Angeles {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|url = http://www.judybaca.com/artist/portfolio/the-great-wall/|website = www.judybaca.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}</ref> In this way, although the term [[artivism]] had not yet been coined at the time of this project, by focusing on the process and involving the community in creating public art work that shared the histories of marginalized people; Judy Baca was engaging in an artivist project. Working with young people was important for Baca because she noticed that many of them who were involved in gangs were also using graffiti to express themselves and claim territory. Baca felt that muralism was one way to redirect these young people’s energy and build community through positive experiences.<ref name=\"Everett 2007 88\">{{Cite book|title = Learning Race and Ethnicity: Youth and Digital Media|last = Everett|first = Anna|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2007|isbn = 0262550679|location = |pages = 88}}</ref>  Even though Baca made a lot of progress in building community with gang involved young people, she struggled with how gendered muraling projects and spaces were. Most of the young people she worked with were young men because as Baca stated “at that time, boys were the only ones parents would allow”.<ref name=\"Everett 2007 88\"/> But Baca also found that there was hostility towards the idea of women in these public spaces and to feminist ideals in general. Because of this, when it came to the Great Wall of LA project, Baca began to actively work to connect to other feminist artists and to actively recruit young women to participate in her muraling projects.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Learning Race and Ethnicity: Youth and Digital Media|last = Everett|first = Anna|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2007|isbn = 0262550679|location = |pages = 89}}</ref>  She had people from all different ages and backgrounds participate. Some were scholars and artists, but the majority were just community members. \"Making a mural is like a big movie production, it can involve 20 sets of scaffolding, four trucks, and food for 50 people.\" 400 people came out to help paint the mural, which took seven summers to complete, and was finished in 1984.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.31\">\"Biography Today\", pp.31</ref> By the end of the project, the mural measured half a mile in length (2,754 feet),<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Great Wall of Los Angeles {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|url = http://www.judybaca.com/artist/portfolio/the-great-wall|website = www.judybaca.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}</ref> and had provided over 400 people with employment and leadership development opportunities.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Learning Race and Ethnicity: Youth and Digital Media|last = Everett|first = Ana|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2007|isbn = 0262550679|location = |pages = 89}}</ref> It’s interesting to note that although the original project called for a mural that represented a history of California from the days of the dinosaurs to the year 1910, Baca instead kept the project going, adding about 350 feet to the mural each year. Although the mural now measures 2,754 feet in length, the mural is not yet complete. The project is proposed to continue until the mural reaches about a mile in length so that it may portray not only contemporary times, but also a vision of the future.<ref name=\"sparcinla.org\"/>  ==Teaching career== Her first teaching job at her former high school, Alemany high school, was short lived as she was let go, due to being involved in public protests against the vietnam war. Baca began a professorship at [[University of California, Irvine]] in 1980, and left in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/3622/Judy-Baca.html |title=Judy Baca Biography - (b. 1946), Murals and SPARC, Works, Social and Public Art Resource Center |publisher=Jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}</ref> The next year, she implemented the Muralist Training Workshop to teach people the techniques she had picked up.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.31\"/> She also served as a professor at [[California State University, Monterey Bay]] from 1994 to 1996, where she co-founded the Visual & Public Arts Institute Department. Judy Baca has been teaching art in the UC system for just over 28 years, 15 of those years have been at the UCLA Ceasar E. Chavez department of chicana/o studies.

She believed the first step to world peace was imagining it, and she wanted artists from all over the world to help her paint it. She wanted it to be painted in panels so it could moved around to different places. After years of planning and contributions made by artists from other countries, the painting had its debut in [[Finland]] in 1990. The idea was that when the panels traveled around the world each host country would add their own panel to the collection. Some of the countries included [[Russia]], [[Israel]]/[[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Mexico]], and [[Canada]].<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.31-32</ref>  In 1988 [[Mayor of Los Angeles]] [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] commissioned her to create the Neighborhood Pride Program, a citywide project to paint murals. The project employed over 1,800 at-risk youth and has been responsible for the creation of over 105 murals throughout the city.  In 1996 she created ''La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra'' (\"Our Land Has Memory\") for the [[Denver International Airport]]. This one was personal for Baca, as her grandparents fled Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution]] and came to [[La Junta, Colorado]], [[Colorado]].<ref name=\"aztlanjournal.metapress.com\"/> The mural's intent was \"not only to tell the forgotten stories of people who, like birds or water, traveled back and forth across the land freely, before there was a line that distinguished which side you were from, but to speak to our shared human condition as temporary residents of the earth...The making of this work was an excavation of a remembering of their histories.\" It was completed in 2000.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.34</ref>  She conducted research by interviewing residents and lead a workshop with [[Colorado State University–Pueblo|University of Southern Colorado]] students. She found a picture in a garage in [[Pueblo]] by Juan Espinosa, photographer and founder El Diario de la Gente, Boulder, Colorado, of an important meeting between [[Rodolfo Gonzales|Corky Gonzales]] of the Colorado Crusade for Justice and [[Cesar Chavez]] of the [[United Farm Workers]], and their agreement to bring the [[Delano grape strike]] to Colorado.<ref name=\"aztlanjournal.metapress.com\"/>  Judy spoke at the \"Against the Wall: The ruin and renewal of LA's murals\" panel held at Morono Kiang Gallery across the street from the famous \"Pope of Broadway\" mural. In that same year, she made the ''Cesar Chavez Monument Arch of Dignity, Equality, and Justice''. It is located at [[San Jose State University]]. It has a portrait of [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Dolores Huerta]].<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.35</ref>  == Recent and current projects == Judy Baca has not slowed down in recent years, she continues to be actively involved in her community, whether that be through her artwork, teaching, community projects, or holding workshops. In march 2010, Baca was part of a mural project in the east bay, Northern california, the richmond mural project. It is a five panel mural that featured different themes in each panel, the goal was to connect the citizens, and share their wildly diverse backgrounds. She was also part of a group that successfully preserved her mural, danza indigenas, in baldwin park, after there were violent protests and vandalism towards the artwork.  Baca has also had a huge part in the group, mural rescue program, which is a program that works to: restore, preserve/stabilize, and conserve murals (both painted and digital) that have been painted or printed on substrates and walls built in public environments. One of Baca's most recent and ongoing projects is “new codex-oaxaca- immigration and cultural memory” this project is about sharing artwork and stories of those who are immigrating from mexico (namely oaxaca) to the US; why are they immigrating, what are they leaving behind, what's happening to make them leave, etc. Baca is involved in choosing the art pieces that are being displayed, community outreach to help come up with ways for these immigrants to have a stable outcome, and just getting a conversation started in the community, using these immigrants artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Judy Baca News {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|url = http://www.judybaca.com/artist/category/judy-baca-news/|website = www.judybaca.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}</ref>  ==Notable collections== *''[[Mi Abuelita]]'', 1970, [[Hollenbeck Park]], [[Los Angeles, California]]<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.26-27\"/> *''[[Great Wall of Los Angeles]]'', 1976–present, Van Nuys, California *''[[History of Unitarianism]]'', 1981, [[First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles]], Los Angeles, California *''[[Danza Indigenas]]'', 1994, [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]], maintained by [[Amtrak]], [[Baldwin Park, California]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/about/art/locations/metrolink/ |title=Location &#124; Metrolink |publisher=Metro.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}</ref> *''[[La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra: Colorado]]'', 2000, [[Denver International Airport]], [[Denver, Colorado]] *[[Digital tile murals]], 2000, City of Los Angeles, [[Venice Beach, California]] *''[[Migration of the Golden People]]'', 2002, Central American Research and Education Center of Los Angeles *''[[Cesar Chavez Monument Plaza]]'', 2008, [[San Jose State University]], [[San Jose, California]]<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.37</ref> *''[[Danza de la Tierra]]'', 2009, Dallas Latino Cultural Center, [[Dallas, Texas]] *''[[Ataco, El Salvador Murals]]'', 2009 Invited by the US embassy, [[Ataco, El Salvador]] *''[[Tiny Ripples of Hope'' and ''Seeing Through Others Eyes]]'', 2010, Robert F.

In London's ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine|Sunday Times Magazine]]'', [[Harold Carlton]] hailed her as \"the completely New Image of the Negro woman. Fashion finds itself in an instrumental position for changing history, however slightly, for it is about to bring out into the open the veneration, the adoration, the idolization of the Negro\".<ref name=\"Stone\"/>   When Stone asked her about whether her appearances in Hollywood films would benefit the cause of black actresses, Luna answered, \"If it brings about more jobs for Mexicans, Asians, Native Americans, Africans, groovy.

Eight teams would take part in each event - five continental and three national. If the stadium had a ninth lane, the host nation could also enter a team. The winning men's and women's teams (and runners-up) from the preceding [[European Team Championships]] qualified as national teams for the World Cup, together with the [[USA Track & Field|United States]]. The continental teams comprised [[Confederation of African Athletics|Africa]], [[Asian Athletics Association|Asia]], [[Oceania Athletics Association|Oceania]], the rest of [[Americas|America]] ([[North American, Central American and Caribbean Athletic Association]] and [[CONSUDATLE|Confederación Sudamericana de Atletismo]]), and the rest of [[European Athletic Association|Europe]]. <!-- The intention was to link each national or continental team in the table to the relevant athletics association (or to the actual team, if there is an article). Some don't appear in the table, so they are linked in the introduction. Some teams in the table have not yet been linked to associations, so they still link to the nation or continent. The Pan-American team represents two associations, so these links are given in the introduction. -->  Beginning with the 2010 event in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]], the format was changed and the competition renamed the IAAF Continental Cup. The number of regional teams was reduced to four: [[Confederation of African Athletics|Africa]], [[Asian Athletics Association|Asia]]/[[Oceania Athletics Association|Pacific]], [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]], each represented by two athletes or one relay team in every event. National teams were eliminated from the competition.

Accessed 13 March 2012.</ref>  The western, [[Gulf St Vincent]], coast of the peninsula consists of a continuous stretch of fine, white sand [[beach]]es. The eastern side is defined and separated from the mainland by the [[Barker Inlet]] and [[Port River]].  [[Torrens Island]] lies nearby to the east. To the east of the base of the peninsula is the suburb of [[Port Adelaide]]. Much of the peninsula has been developed, with residential areas extending inland from the western beaches, and heavy industries concentrated along the Port River waterfront on its eastern shore. It extends from the suburbs of [[Semaphore South, South Australia|Semaphore South]] and [[Ethelton, South Australia|Ethelton]] in the south to [[North Haven, South Australia|North Haven]], [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] and [[Pelican Point, Adelaide|Pelican Point]] in the north.

The land was extensively covered with bush, with such plants as [[Acacia|wattle]], [[sheoak]] and other native species.<ref>Couper-Smartt ''op cit'' p 23</ref> The peninsula now has a wind swept feel due to the clearance of these plants.   The peninsula has strong maritime associations due to its proximity to Port Adelaide, the Port River and Outer Harbor. [[Collins class submarine]]s were built at the suburb of [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]]. Cement production also occurs on the peninsula at [[Birkenhead, South Australia|Birkenhead]]. In 1999, the [[Pelican Point Power Station]] was established at the northeastern tip of the peninsula adjacent to the Port River.<ref>[http://www.ipplc.com.au/Page.php?iPageID=33 Pelican Point Power Station], International Power plc Australia, 2007.</ref>  Lefevre Peninsula also contains several sailing clubs and golf clubs and the popular Semaphore Road foreshore and .

Its population was 2,390 at the 2010 census. The village is the most densely populated portion of the town. The village is named for two early farmer landowners, Walter and James Brewster.<ref name=\"BTTY\">Brewster Through the Years 1848-1948, H. Wolff Book Manufacturing Co., New York 1948</ref>  == History ==  The village of Brewster derives its name from the landowner, Walter Brewster, who invited [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] to build a depot on his property.  Brewster's Station, New York, (sometimes just \"Brewster's\") appeared on maps,<ref name=\"BeersBrewster\">[http://www.westchesterarchives.com/CW/images/WCHS/Atlas_1867/Title%20_page_resize.jpg] ''Beers 1867 Atlas'' \"Atlas of New York and Vicinity from Actual Surveys by and Under the Direction of F.W. Beers, A.D. Ellis and G.G. Soule, New York 1867\"</ref> on postcards and in directories of Putnam County throughout the second half of the 19th century. Although referred to as a village since it formed in 1849, it officially incorporated as the Village of Brewster, New York, in 1894.  In 1886, historian William Smith Pelletreau published ''The History of Putnam County, New York''.  In his second chapter on the town of [[Southeast, New York|Southeast]], he wrote: \"The land now [1886] embraced within the limits of the village of Brewster consists of a farm which was sold by the commissioners of forfeiture to Peleg Bailey, in 1781.  A portion of it afterward passed into the possession of Bailey Howes, his grandson, who sold 98 acres to Gilbert Bailey, April 1st 1833.  Two other tracts containing 39 acres were sold to Gilbert Bailey, by William P. Downs and Frederick Parks in 1838.  On the 17th of February, 1848, Gilbert Bailey sold the whole tracts, estimated at 134 acres, to James and Walter F. Brewster, for the sum of $8,000.\"<ref name=\"Pelletreau\">The History of Putnam County, New York. 1886. Reprinted by the Landmarks Preservation Committee of the Southeast Museum, Brewster, New York 1975</ref>   \"At the time of the purchase, the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] was finished and trains were running as far as [[Croton Falls, New York|Croton Falls]].  The road was surveyed as far as [[Pawling (town), New York|Pawling]], and the prospect of its being continued to that point seemed certain, and to the new purchasers of the farm it seemed just the place for a station.\"<ref name=\"Pelletreau\" />  \"The New York and Harlem Railroad was finished to this place and the depot was built in that year, and what is now [1886] the Main street was opened, for the purpose of allowing the stages from [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] to come to the station.  Previous to this the firm of Crosby and DeForest had run a line of four horse stages to Croton Falls, from Danbury.  The first new house in the place was built by Walter F. Brewster, in 1850 and stood in front of the present [1886] Methodist church.\"<ref name=\"Pelletreau\" />  That house, now listed as the [[Walter Brewster House]] on the New York State and national historic registers, is owned by the [[Landmark Preservation Society of Southeast]].  \"The Harlem Railroad's extension of its mileage in 1849 proved advantageous to Mr. Brewster, who needed all sorts of materials in his building activities.  Large shipments were billed simply to 'Brewster's Station' for lack of better designation.  This is the apparent origin of the village's name, which many years ago was shortened to Brewster.\"<ref name=\"BTTY\" />  === Post offices === Jonathan F. Frost was the first Postmaster of the Brewster's Station post office, which operated from October 25, 1850 through April 28, 1883.<ref name=\"PostalHistory\">''New York Postal History: The Post Offices and First Postmaster from 1775 to 1980'' by John L. Kay and Chester M. Smith, Jr., American Philatelic Society, 1982</ref>  During this period in American history, post offices were frequently located in the stores or businesses owned by the individuals who served as postmasters.  This held true in the village of Brewster for the next century.  In 1863 the Brewster Station post office relocated to the A.F. Lobdell General Store, across from the railroad station, the present location of the Avery Building at 12-18 Main Street.  Alexander F. Lobdell, the store's proprietor, was appointed postmaster by President Abraham Lincoln and was reappointed by Presidents Grant, Hayes, Garfield and Arthur, continuing as Brewster's postmaster until 1887.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\">The Town of Southeast  1788-1988   Edited by Suzanne F. Truran, John J. Dunford, Priscilla A. Truran  - Pub. by the Town of Southeast, 1990</ref>  The Brewster post office began operation on April 28, 1883, removing the word \"Station\" in its identity and postmarks.<ref name=\"PostalHistory\" />  In 1887, the post office relocated to the Brewster Standard building, the present location of the Sprague Building at 31 Main Street.  In 1886, Emerson W. Addis, publisher of the ''Brewster Standard'' weekly newspaper, became the postmaster and held that position until 1916.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\" />  In 1916, the post office moved to new quarters on Park Street, between Main Street and Marvin Avenue, into the Rundall Building, and John Thorp became the new postmaster.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\" />  In 1923, Ralph Diehl, proprietor of the Brewster Bakery, became postmaster, and the post office was moved to his baking plant on Progress Street in 1927.  Howard Tuttle later became the postmaster, holding the position until 1934 when Seth Howes was appointed.  In 1936, the post office relocated to the building now occupied by the Eagle Eye Thrift Shop at 65 Main Street.  Mr. Howes held the office until 1958 when John F. Larkin, Jr. was made acting postmaster.  He was later promoted to the full title of postmaster.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\" />  On July 17, 1966, the post office relocated to a new brick building on Main Street, where it remained for the next three decades. Mr. Larkin retired in 1972 and was succeeded by Earl Tuttle, who became the last Southeast resident to hold the position of postmaster since that time. Mr. Tuttle retired in 1985.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\" />  The new facility was the first Brewster post office to occupy a space that was specifically designed for the purpose, rather than being retrofitted from some previous use.  It had a separate lobby to house post office boxes, a loading dock at the rear of the building and a postal inspector's separate entrance and hallway with one-way glass for observing postal workers and the public.  In the mid-1990s, the Main Street facility closed and a new post office opened at its present location at 3 Mount Ebo Road North outside the village limits in the town of Southeast.  Although the new facility is more than {{convert|3|mi|0}} from the center of Brewster, it still retains the designation and postmark \"Brewster 10509\".  === \"Brewster\" vs. \"Southeast\" === [[File:Brewster NY from Metro North.JPG|thumb|View of village from train station]] The town of [[Southeast, New York|Southeast]] contains the village of Brewster, though each of those municipalities have independent governments, separate highway departments and separate courts, although the government of the Town of Southeast has jurisdiction over Brewster. In common usage, though technically incorrect, \"Brewster\" refers to the entire town, rather than just the village.  The railroad station in downtown Brewster, owned in turn by the [[New York Central]], [[Conrail]], [[Penn Central]] and now [[Metro-North Railroad]], has always been known as \"Brewster\" because it is located in the village of Brewster.  Since 1849, rail customers coming to Southeast only knew they were travelling to \"Brewster\".  Over time, the name Southeast was all but forgotten.  The new depot that was built in Southeast, just a quarter mile north of the village, was first named \"Brewster North\".  That second depot has since been renamed \"Southeast\".  Before 1962, there were several local post offices throughout the town of Southeast, located near larger concentrations of residences and businesses.  The last of these, Southeast's Putnam Lake post office, closed in 1968.<ref name=\"PostalHistory\" /> When a new post office opened at 16 Main Street in Brewster on July 17, 1966,<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\"/> even before [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] and [[Interstate 684]] were constructed, it was named Brewster and given the zip code 10509.<ref name=\"PostalHistory\" />   The two highways brought massive population increases, nearly tripling the number of residents in Southeast in a matter of about 20 years.  As a result, \"Brewster, NY 10509\" was part of the return address of every resident of Southeast and Brewster. Probably because of the proximity to the Brewster train station, the highway exit signs of I-84 and I-684 say \"Brewster\". Road signs in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[Carmel, New York|Carmel]] and other nearby towns all direct travelers to Brewster.  Only the town's \"Welcome to Southeast\" signs acknowledge the town's existence.    The post office has relocated out of the village and removed \"Brewster\" from the building. The ZIP code is still 10509 but does not have the name of the municipality on its exterior of the building. Residents who live in the town still use \"Brewster 10509\" for their return address, and the post office still uses \"Brewster\" rather than \"Southeast\" in its postmarks.  ==Geography== [[File:Chondrodite-Magnetite-37952.jpg|thumb|Red [[chondrodite]] and black [[magnetite]] from the old [[Tilly Foster Mine]] in Brewster]] Brewster is located along the [[East Branch Croton River|East Branch]] of the [[Croton River]] at {{Coord|41|23|46|N|73|36|57|W|type:city}} (41.396050, -73.615954),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> near the center of the town of Southeast.

The dome, horizontal or tilted, is filled with real-time (interactive) or pre-rendered (linear) [[computer animation]]s, live capture images, or [[compositing|composited]] environments.  Although the current technology emerged in the early-to-mid 1990s, fulldome environments have evolved from numerous influences, including immersive art and storytelling, with technological roots in [[dome|domed architecture]], [[planetarium]]s, multi-projector film environments, [[flight simulation]], and [[virtual reality]].  Initial approaches to moving fulldome imagery used wide-angle lenses, both [[35 mm film|35]] and [[70 mm film]], but the expense and ungainly nature of the film medium prevented much progress; furthermore, film formats such as [[Omnimax]] did not cover the full two [[pi]] [[steradian]]s of the dome surface, leaving a section of the dome blank (though, due to seating arrangements, that part of the dome was not seen by most viewers). Later approaches to fulldome utilized monochromatic [[vector graphics|vector graphics systems]] projected through a [[fisheye lens]]. Contemporary configurations employ raster [[video projectors]], either singly or grouped together to cover the dome surface with full-color images and animations.  == Video technology ==  Fulldome video projection can use a variety of technologies in two typical formats: single- and multiple-projector systems. The individual projector(s) can be driven by a variety of video sources, typically feeding material rendered in either real-time or “pre-rendered” modes. The end result is a video image that covers an entire domed projection surface, yielding an immersive experience that fills a viewer’s field of view.  === Single- versus multiple-projector systems ===  Single-projector fulldome video systems use a single (or mixed) video source displayed through a single fisheye lens, typically located at or near the center of a hemispherical projection surface. A single projector has the benefit of avoiding edge blends (see below) between multiple projectors. The main disadvantage of single fisheye systems is that they are limited to the resolution of one projector, and in the smallest dimension of the video image to cover a full dome.  Another disadvantage of central projectors is the loss of the center of the dome for optimal viewing of the reconstructed perspective view provided by true hemispheric projection, a problem shared with traditional planetarium projectors.  However, this disadvantage fades as audience size increases (everyone cannot be at the center of the dome anyway).  Single-projector mirror systems, pioneered by Mirrordome from Swinburne, but now offered by a plethora of manufacturers, are placed on the edge of the dome to increase seating, decrease costs, and to allow analog planetariums to become digital without giving up their star projector.  It is also possible to build such a system at relatively low cost.  The main disadvantage is noticeably lower projection quality compared to purpose built lenses, despite being able to project a higher proportion of the projector resolution.  Multiple-projector fulldome video systems rely on two or more video projectors edge-blended to create a seamless image that covers a hemispherical projection surface; splitting the entire image up into segments allows for higher-resolution imagery and projector placement that does not intrude on the viewing area underneath the dome. A disadvantage of multiple projection is the need to frequently adjust the alignment of projectors and the uneven aging of separate projectors leading to brightness and color differences between segments. Even minor performance differences between projectors can be obvious when projecting a solid color across the entire scene.  Edge blended areas where projectors overlap often have some smearing, double images, and can have very obvious additive black level areas if poorly designed or configured.  === Common video projector technology ===  A wide variety of video projection technologies has been employed in domes, including [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP), [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD), [[liquid crystal on silicon]] (LCOS), and most recently, two varieties of laser projectors (see the [[laser video projector]]).  For multi-projector systems in particular, display devices must have a low [[black level]] (i.e., project little or no light when no signal is sent to them) to allow for reasonable edge-blending between the different projector footprints. Otherwise, overlapping video images will have an additive effect, causing a complex pattern of grey to appear even when no image is being projected. This becomes particularly important for users in the [[planetarium]] field, who have a vested interest in projecting a dark night sky. The desire for projectors to “go to black” has resulted in continued use of CRT technology, even as newer and less expensive technologies have emerged.  LCD projectors have fundamental limits on their ability to project true black as well as light, which has tended to limit their use in planetariums. LCOS and modified LCOS projectors have improved on LCD [[contrast ratio]]s while also eliminating the “screen door” effect of small gaps between LCD pixels. “Dark chip” DLP projectors improve on the standard DLP design and can offer relatively inexpensive solution with bright images, but the black level requires physical baffling of the projectors. As the technology matures and reduces in price, laser projection looks promising for dome projection as it offers bright images, large dynamic range and a very wide [[color space]].  DOME lenses and standard lens are similar in some ways. They both depend on the type of display device, LCD, DLP, LCOS, DILA and the size chip or panel that is part of this device. The unique feature of the DOME lens is the actual shape of the glass, the projected image spill out from the top and all around circumference of the lens. The biggest advantage is how this type of lens maintains focus over the full 180 x 180 field of view. A single standard flat field or curved field lens would have major focus and distortion issue. Several lens developers offer DOME lenses with each designed to a specific projector class and display device. These lenses can cover a variety of pixel sizes and display resolutions.  === Types of content ===  Computer Generated (CG) content is the main source of material for Fulldome.  CG content can be live simulator output, such as from planetarium simulation software, or prerecorded fulldome video.  [[Live-Action FullDome]] videos are becoming more available for dome use as digital video camera resolutions increase.  ==History== {{external links|section|date=July 2015}} {| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"4\" cellpadding=\"5\" |- valign=\"top\" | 1983 || First [[Evans & Sutherland]] Digistar I calligraphic scan (projection of light points and lines - also known as vector scan) planetarium projector at the [[Science Museum of Virginia]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], U.S.A. |- valign=\"top\" | 1992 || First dome-based vector/calligraphic scan scientific visualization system at [[SIGGRAPH]], installed by the [[North Carolina Supercomputing Center]] using a reprogrammed Digistar I for molecular visualization |- valign=\"top\" | 1994 || [[Alternate Realities Corporation]] premieres their first [[VisionDome]] prototype at [[Glaxo]] Inc. in [[Research Triangle Park, North Carolina]], U.S.A.

Along with the unfinished battleship {{Ship|French battleship|Jean Bart|1940|2}}, they engaged the Allied 'Covering Group', a taskforce based on the battleship {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|6}}.

This was the second time the [[Upstate New York]] village hosted the Games, after [[1932 Winter Olympics|1932]]. The only other candidate city to bid for the Games was [[Vancouver]]-[[Garibaldi, British Columbia|Garibaldi]], British Columbia, Canada; which withdrew before the final vote.  The [[List of Olympic mascots|mascot]] of the Games was \"Roni\", a [[raccoon]]. The mask-like rings on a raccoon's face recall the [[goggles]] and hats worn by many athletes in winter sports.  The sports were played at the Olympic Center (later renamed [[Herb Brooks Arena]]), [[Whiteface Mountain]], [[Mt. Van Hoevenberg Olympic Bobsled Run]], the Olympic Ski Jumps, the Cascade Cross Country Ski Center, and the Lake Placid High School Speed Skating Oval.  ==Host selection== The selection process for the 1980 Winter Olympics consisted of one bid, from [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], United States. It was selected at the 75th IOC Session in [[Vienna]] on October 13, 1974.<ref name=votes>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Past Olympic host city election results |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=March 17, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xFvf0ufx |archivedate=March 17, 2011}}</ref>  == Highlights == Notable highlights included: * The United States men's [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|ice hockey]] team, composed mostly of collegiate players and not predicted to advance beyond group play, won the gold medal, defeating the heavily favored [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet]] team and [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] in the medal round. The United States team's 4–3 win over the Soviet team, which came into the 1980 Games having won 4 consecutive Olympic gold medals, became known as the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" in the US press. The win captured the hearts of Americans during a time of Cold War tensions, even though it was the win against [[Finland]] that captured the gold medal. (The Soviet team ultimately won the silver medal.) *[[Eric Heiden]] of the United States won gold in the 500m, 1000m, 1500m, 5000m, and 10,000m [[Speed skating at the 1980 Winter Olympics|speedskating]] events, setting 4 Olympic records and 1 world record (10,000m) in the process and delivering 83% of the American gold medals (the only other gold, as noted above, was won by the hockey team). Heiden became the first to ever win all five speed skating events and is still the [[List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games|only athlete to win 5 gold medals at one Winter Games]].  * [[Sweden]]'s [[Ingemar Stenmark]] won both the giant slalom and the slalom. * [[Hanni Wenzel]] won the women's giant slalom and slalom, making [[Liechtenstein]] the smallest country to produce an Olympic champion. * [[Ulrich Wehling]] of [[East Germany]] and [[Irina Rodnina]] of the [[USSR at the Winter Olympics|USSR]] won their respective events for the third time, Wehling in [[Nordic combined]] and Rodnina in [[pair skating|pairs figure skating]]. * [[Aleksandr Tikhonov]] of the [[USSR at the Winter Olympics|USSR]] earned his fourth straight gold medal as part of the 4 x 7.5m [[biathlon]] relay team. * [[Nikolay Zimyatov]] of the [[USSR at the Winter Olympics|USSR]] earned three gold medals in cross-country skiing. * [[Robin Cousins]] won gold for Great Britain in the men's singles figure skating. * East Germany won the most medals overall (23) but had fewer golds (9) than the USSR (10). * In possibly the most dramatic duel of the games, [[Sweden]]'s [[Thomas Wassberg]] edged [[Finland]]'s [[Juha Mieto]] in the 15&nbsp;km cross-country skiing by 0.01 seconds, the closest margin of victory ever in Olympic [[Cross-country skiing at the 1980 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]]. This led the [[International Ski Federation]] (ISF) to time all events to the nearest 1/10 second in the future.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} * Although they did not get any medals, the People's Republic of China entered the Olympics Games for the first time after the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] agreed to designate the [[Republic of China]] \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\". * Lake Placid 1980 marked the first use of artificial snow in Olympic competition. * Lake Placid 1980 was the last Olympics to be opened by the [[Vice President of the United States]], as 1980 was a Presidential election year.  == Sports == [[Image:Lake Placid - Cauldron.jpg|thumb|The Olympic cauldron]] [[File:Lake Placid - Ski jumps.jpg|thumb|The [[Lake Placid Olympic Ski Jumping Complex|Ski Jumping Complex]].]] There were 38 events contested in 6 sports (10 disciplines).

[[Cyprus]] made their Olympic debut at the 1980 Winter Olympics. The People's Republic of China and [[Costa Rica]] both made their Winter Olympic debut.

Following a fire in 1849, the [[Market Square, Cambridge|Market Square]] was redeveloped and in 1855 a [[Gothic Revival]] gabled fountain was erected (marked on many contemporary maps as \"lavatory\" as there were underground public conveniences here) and the original structure of Hobson's Conduit was moved.

In his youth Ibn Ḥabib studied the Talmud under rabbi [[Samuel Valensi]].  == ''Ein Yaakov'' == In 1492, when the Jews were [[Spanish expulsion|expelled from Spain]], he settled at [[Salonica]], where he wrote his ''[[Ein Yaakov]]'' in the house of Don Judah [[Benveniste]] grandson of Don Abraham Benveniste, who placed his rich library at his disposal. Ibn Ḥabib also availed himself of the library of Don Shemuel Benveniste the brother of Judah, which contained, among other great works, a large collection of novellæ on the Talmud by many distinguished commentators. By the aid of the works from these two libraries Ibn Ḥabib collected all the [[aggadah|haggadic]] passages from the [[Babylonian Talmud]], and many from the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. The publication of this work began in 1516 in the printing establishment of Judah Gedaliah, the author himself carefully reading the proof-sheets; but he died at Salonica just as the first two orders ([[Zeraim]] and [[Moed]]) came from the press. His son, R. Levi, completed the labors of his father, but the work appeared before the public without the notes of the author to the last four orders (\"sedarim\"), and without the index, which the author originally intended to cover the entire work. The [[aggadah|haggadot]] of the Jerusalem Talmud are also lacking.  The ''Ein Yaakov'' is the only work Ibn Ḥabib left to the world. The object of the author was to familiarize the public with the ethical spirit of Talmudic literature; at the same time his notes were intended to refute the charges brought against the Talmud by the numerous Spanish converts. The book, which thus appealed to the mass of the unlearned, became very popular. It was often edited and annotated, and served as a text-book of religious instruction. There are over thirty editions known; the latest ([[Vilnius|Vilna]], 1883) contains twenty commentaries, among them one which consists of selections from more than one hundred homiletic works. Of the additions, the most important one is that of [[Leon of Modena|Leone di Modena]], under the title ''Ha-Boneh,'' which has appeared in all editions since 1684. The author's intention was chiefly to propagate a more rationalistic view of the Talmudic [[Aggadah|Haggadah]]. In some editions the title of the whole work is ''Ein Yisrael.''  == References == * {{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=H&artid=16|article=Habib, Jacob (ben Solomon) ibn}}  ;Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography * Besides the bibliographical works s.v., see the introduction of the author and the various commentators in the Wilna edition of 1883 * [[Zunz]], G.

He held the position of notary while serving the council and was also appointed curator of the estates of minors and interstate estates for the viceroyalty of Mexico.  In 1802, he was recalled from the council to become [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]]'s private secretary.  As such, he was sent to represent the king at the 1804 coronation of [[Napoleon]].  His position allowed him to make a tour through western and central Europe.  Velázquez resigned his post after Charles IV was forced to abdicate and later imprisoned by Napoleon in 1809.  After receiving news of Hidalgo's Mexican independence movement, he made arrangements to return to Mexico.  Velazquez was unwilling to identify with either of the contending parties and thus resolved to settle in New York, where his scholarly career began.  ==Language Contributions== Once in [[New York]], Velazquez devoted himself to one of his greatest passions—language.  He taught Spanish and founded a collegiate institute where many young Latin American men were educated.  Velázquez also joined the esteemed professors of [[Columbia University]] to teach [[Spanish language|Castilian]] language and literature.  Aside from teaching, he was a member of learned societies in Europe and the United States and author of Spanish school-books and Spanish-English language [[Bilingual dictionary|dictionaries]].  Some of his English, Spanish, and German works include: ''Dufief's, Ellendorff's New Method'', ''An Easy Introduction to Spanish Conversation'', ''New Spanish Reader'', ''A New Method of Learning to Read, Write, and Speak the Spanish Language'', ''Elementos de la lengua castellana fundados en los principios establecidos por la academia española y en el uso de los autores clásicos'', and ''Spanisches Lesebuch: Enthaltend ausgewählte Stücke aus Spanischen Musterschriftststellern in gebundener und ungebundener Rede''.  ==Legacy== In 1852, Velázquez used [[Dr. Don Mateo Seoane]]'s edition of the revered [[Neumon and Baretti Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages]] as a basis for his version, A Pronouncing Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages. Velázquez's dictionary became the preeminent authority in Spanish-English dictionaries, giving editors and publishers the model for Spanish-English dictionaries. Edward Gray revised the first edition, creating A New Pronouncing Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages almost a half century later.  Several revisions have been made to Velazquez's first edition, the most recent by [[Velázquez Press]] in 2003, helping it remain a venerable dictionary throughout the world.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== * [http://www.velazquezpress.com Velázquez Spanish-English Dictionary] - Velázquez Press * [http://archive.org/details/anewpronouncing00iribgoog A new pronouncing dictionary of the Spanish and English languages (1900)] - Archive.Org * [http://archive.org/details/anewspanishread00cadegoog A New Spanish Reader ...

The village of Oliveira used to belong to the village of [[Tiradentes, Minas Gerais|São José do Rio das Mortes]], which is the current [[Tiradentes, Minas Gerais|Tiradentes (Minas Gerais)]], and it already possessed a chapel in 1758. The village was raised to the title of [[parish]] on July 14, 1832, and then raised to a town, on March 16, 1839 by the provincial law nº 134. Finally, it was lifted to the title of city on September 19, 1861. Differently than other cities in the same region, such as [[Ouro Preto]] and [[São João Del Rei]], Oliveira did not emerge due to the exploration of gold and diamond, instead, the development of livestock and agriculture activities were the main reasons. Such activities began with the [[Bandeirantes]] that started to migrate from [[São Paulo]] to the countryside of [[Minas Gerais]]. During the transition from village to city, the municipality had always stood as a strategic place for goods exchange and capital flow, as it was an important path for travellers. Therefore, all these reasons were responsible for the rapidly growth of the municipality at that time. After the end of [[slavery in Brazil]], the Brazilian government stimulated the immigration. Oliveira received Syrian and Lebanese settlers, who managed the commerce activities. Moreover, the city had a very strong Portuguese influence, mainly in architecture.  There are two versions about the origin of the Oliveira's name. There are stories that the first inhabitants of the region found some olive trees. Therefore, they named the place \"Oliveiras\" that later would be simplified to Oliveira. However, there is a rumor that a portuguese woman, called Dona Maria de Oliveira, used to live in the region during the second half of the 18th century. She used to live in a house in the region where Oliveira currently exists, when the first [[Bandeirantes]] started to travel towards [[Goiás]]. Therefore, Oliveira was named because of her surname.  In the beginning of the 20th century, the city became around the world, as it was the birth place of the famous scientist [[Carlos Chagas]]. He discovered the [[Chagas disease]] and he was the pioneer in the research of diseases caused by protozoa. He was also indicated to the [[Nobel Prize]] in the beginning of the 20th century in [[Germany]].  == Geography == Oliveira is located at [[latitude]] 20º41'45\" south and [[longitude]] 44º49'37\" west.

It has the greatest First Aid Post (Emergency Department) of the Middle-West of Minas Gerais, which has been opened. Oliveira's architecture has a clearly Iberian Influence and it is visibly the most european-like city in the region. Such architecture is highly expressed in the great 19th-century mansions, statues, monuments spread along the city. Its squares and avenues are well decorated and its buildings are remarkable, such as Our Lady of Oliveira Cathedral (Catedral de Nossa Senhora de Oliveira), which is based on Roman [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] style and the old Matriz Church built in [[baroque]] style during the 18th century. Furthermore, there are several modern buildings in the city.  === Highways === Oliveira is located at a strategic place and it is crossed by three important federal and state highways:  * [[BR-494]] * [[BR-369]] * [[BR-381]]  === Railroads === [[File:Ferrovia Oliveira.jpg|thumb|450px|Centro-Atlantic Railroad passing through the city.]] The Centro-Atlantic Railroad (Ferrovia Centro-Atlântica) passes through Oliveira and links interior areas of Brazil to the coast.  === Airport === Oliveira has an airport, which runway is 1,180 meters length and 20 meters width.

It is happening earlier and in a faster rate than it has been predicted for Brazilian Population in general. There are several reasons for this fact, but it can mainly attributed to the small birth and death rates in the city. According to the IBGE's census,<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://cidades.ibge.gov.br/painel/populacao.php?lang=&codmun=314560&search=minas-gerais{{!}}oliveira{{!}}infograficos:-evolucao-populacional-e-piramide-etaria |title=Infográficos: Evolução populacional e pirâmide etária |publisher= [[IBGE]] |date=2010 |accessdate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> Oliveira's population presents a faster aging process than the average of the state of Minas Gerais and the rest of the country.  == Economy ==  Oliveira's economy is mainly based on services sector (Tertiary sector).

Oliveira is also located in a very dynamic and richest region in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. Furthermore, Oliveira is placed in the top average monthly income per capita when compared with the surrounding municipalities.

As Oliveira's history is highly based on the Iberian culture brought by its Portuguese settlers, Roman Catholicism is predominant in the city. However, other religions with less number of followers are also present in the city.  === Catholicism ===  According to IBGE's<ref name=\"oliveira1\">{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.cidades.ibge.gov.br/xtras/temas.php?lang=&codmun=314560&idtema=91&search=minas-gerais|title=Resultados da Amostra por Religião em Oliveira |publisher= [[IBGE]]|date=2010 |accessdate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> census in 2010, there are 34,938 catholics in Oliveira, which is aroung 84% of the population.  As said before, a traditional Oliveirense is a religious person. Roman Catholicism was brought by Portuguese settlers and it is still predominant in the city. This tradition led to the creation of the Diocese of Oliveira in 1941.  The Diocese of Oliveira was created in December 20, 1941, by Pope Pius XII (Bula Quo uberiores fructus), as a result of the dismemberment of [[Belo Horizonte]]'s Archdiocese. The diocese is located in the mid-south region of the state of [[Minas Gerais]] bordering the dioceses of [[Campanha]], [[Divinópolis]], [[Luz]] and [[São João del Rei]] and the archdioceses of [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]]. The entire territory is almost 8.000&nbsp;km² with a population of 300 thousand believers. In total, there are 28 parishes distributed in Oliveira's surroundings municipalities: [[Aguanil]], [[Bom Sucesso, Minas Gerais|Bom Sucesso]], [[Campo Belo]], [[Cana Verde]], [[Candeias]], [[Carmo da Mata]], [[Carmópolis de Minas]], [[Cristais]], [[Desterro de Entre Rios]], [[Itaguara]], Oliveira, [[Passa Tempo]], [[Perdões]], [[Piracema]], [[Ribeirão Vermelho]], [[Santana do Jacaré]], [[Santo Antônio do Amparo]], [[São Francisco de Paula, Minas Gerais|São Francisco de Paula]] and [[São Tiago]].  === Other Religions ===  Although most of Oliveira's population is catholic, there are other religions with less number of believers. According to IBGE's<ref name=\"oliveira1\"/> census in 2010, other religious such as Kardecists, Evangelicals also have considerable number of believers. People without any religion can also be found in the city. The following list summarizes the number of believers in some minor religions in the city:  ;Minor Religions: * Evangelicals: 3,373 * Kardecists: 398 * No Religion: 324 (62 atheists) * Jehovah's Witnesses: 179 * Buddhism: 22 * Umbanda e Candomblé: 13  ==Administration==  The current administration of the municipality can be seen in the list below: * [[Mayor]]: João da Batista de Sousa (2013/2016) * [[Deputy Mayor]]: Salatiel Alvim Lobato * President of the City Council Chamber: Leonardo Ananias Leão * Deputy President of the City Council Chamber: Francisco José Ribeiro Filho  ==Culture== [[File:Cai'náguas.jpg|thumb|left|300px|\"Cainágua\", centennial tradition in Oliveira's Carnaval.]]  The most famous cultural manifestation in the city is the [[Carnival]](Carnaval Party). Oliveira's Carnaval is one of the most famous in Minas Gerais. The main figure of the city's Carnaval is the \"Cainágua\", which literally means \"fall into the water\" or someone who falls into the water. It is said that the \"Caináguas\" are an adaption of the masked figures in [[Carnival of Venice|Venice's Carnaval]]. In Oliveira, the \"Caináguas\" were created from old roleplays where people wore masks to become unrecognizable during the party, so it would allow the party goers to get in touch with any other kind of people.  Another important feature of Oliveira's Carnaval is the group \"Pelo amor de Deus\", which literally means \"For God's sake\". The group was created by José Alberto Machado da Silva, followed by Maurício Almeida. The group usually party in Oliveira's city centre in the friday night during Carnaval celebrations. Each \"folião\" (Carnaval goer) dresses a different costume to party with the group.  The municipality has a strong cultural identity, which was constantly built over two centuries of existence. It was largely influenced by Portuguese culture and other people that immigrated to Brazil. Those people built a series of cultural events in the city. Therefore, the Carnaval party, the Holy Week and the Congado are some of this events throughout the year.  == Tourism == [[File:Vellha Matriz.jpg|thumb||300px|Matriz Church in [[Baroque]] style built by the Portuguese settlers in the XVIII century. One of the few ones to possess two circular steeples.]]  The main touristic attractions in Oliveira are: * A Grande Estátua do Cristo Redentor (Big Statue of Christ Redempteur) * Casa de Cultura Carlos Chagas (Carlos Chagas Culture House) * Antiga Igreja Matriz (Matriz Church, which was built in Baroque style)  The urban aspect of Oliveira is very traditional and impress visitors.

This village was at the headwaters of the Swarnamuki River. It is 10&nbsp;km from [[Tirumala - Tirupati|Tirupati]] and is home to a major temple for [[Lord Siva]] called Agastheeswara (MUKKOTI). Population of the village is more than 2500 people. Seasonal crops like [[sugar cane]], [[rice|paddy]] and [[mangoes]] are cultivated around the village.  ==Village representatives== * Current MP : Naramalli Sivaprasad  * Current MLA : Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy * Current ZPTC  * Current MPTC  * Current President  ==Sri Maragadhavalli Sameetha Shri Agastheeshwara Swamy Temple (Mukkoti) ==  The temple of Agastheeswara Swami is a sacred shrine that lies at the confluence of three rivers Swarnamukhi, Bhima and Kalyani in Chandragiri mandal.  The Siva lingam in this temple was installed by Agasthya Mahamuni and so it is called Agastheeswara lingam. This temple faces east and has almost all parivaradevathas installed in well-built places like Lord Ganesha, Lord Subramaniyam.  The temple has three entrances and a grand compound wall. The Dwarapalakas at the entrance of the sanctum sanctorum are beautifully sculptured. They stand tall to add grandeur to the hall. Inside the second prakara, there is a separate shrine for Mother Parvati called here by the name of Vallimata. There is a tank outside the compound for the convenience of visiting pilgrims. The nearby village was named Tondavada by the kings of Chandragiri, as it was the place used as a rest house for visitors and keeping elephants also.  Just opposite the Aalaya (temple) and in the middle of the river there is a mandapam built. In this, you can see the beautiful statues of Balaji, Ayyappa, Ganapati, etc., installed.   There is also a small shrine of Lord Sri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Anjaneya that is built in recent times near the tank. All these places are worth visiting.  Sri Agastheswara Swamy Temple This temple has an inscription engraved on its wall. It is dated in the 31st year of Kulothunga Chola, but this is not a foundation inscription. This inscription may be helpful at best in setting the latter limit i.e. 1100-01 AD for its foundation. This temple square on plan has an ekatala and a square sikhara among the five types described above.  This temple may be classified under the type I represented by the Irugisvara temple at Yatavakili. The points of similarities are the square plan and the square sikhara, the absence of niches on the walls, niches with griva with nandis at the corners.  The most important difference however, is the protruding niche on the griva where the sthambha and the kirthimukha are more prominent and the placement of sculpture in the niches is subdued, while in the temple at Yatavakili the figure is more prominent, the sthambha is almost absent and the kirthimukha is less pronounced.  The niche appears to be an integral part of the griva in the Irugisvara temple at Yatavakili unlike in the Agasthyeswara temple. This is later in date than the Chandramalliswara temple at Yatavakili which, though renovated in the time of Rajaraja III. It appears to have retained the features of its original construction during the time of Rajendra I.  '''The uniqueness and rarity about this Temple''' Unlike other temples, here Goddess Maragadhavalli appears to the left hand side of Lord Agastheeshwara swamy temple resembling the sitting posture of a Bride and a Bride groom in a marriage as per the Hindu religious practice. This could be visualized in most ancient temples only.  Instead of Navagrahas, the Sapthamathrukas were installed here. They are Kowmari, Vaishnavi, Vaarahi, Bramhi, Mahedri, Mahishwari and Chamundi. The same blessings are available to those who worship the Sapthamathrukas instead of Navagrahas. If one visits this temple could realize the sanctity of the ancient temple.  * Distance: 8.5&nbsp;km from Tirupati, RTC Bus stand and 8&nbsp;km from Tirupati Railway station  ==Muthyalamma Temple == Muthyalamma temple is a shakti temple and villagers believe this goddess guard the village from the evil forms.

Licensed to  the city of [[Eugene, Oregon]], it serves the Eugene-[[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]] metropolitan area. The station is currently owned by [[Cumulus Media]], and affiliated with [[ABC News Radio]]. KUGN partners with local CBS television affiliate [[KVAL-TV|KVAL]] for breaking news and weather coverage.  KUGN is the flagship radio station of the Oregon Sports Network, and broadcasts [[University of Oregon]] football and basketball games. KUGN also broadcasts local high school football and basketball games. On weekdays, KUGN airs four-and-a-half hours of local news and talk programming, local and national news twice per hour, and nationally syndicated talk shows.  ==Programming== Talk programming includes:  *  ''KUGN Morning News'' with Storm Kennedy and Grant McHill *  [[Jonathan Brandmeier 9a to noon]] *  [[Michael Savage noon to 3p]] *  [[Mark Levin 3p-6p]] *  [[John Batchelor 6p-8p]] *  [[Seant Hannity 8p to 11p]] *  [[Jerry Doyle 11p to 1a]] *  [[Doug Stephan 1a to 5a]] *  [[Jim Bohanan 5ato 5:30a]] *  [[Bill Handel Wkends(Handel on the Law)]] *  [[Kim Komando Wkends]] *  ''Money Talk'' with [[Bob Brinker wkend]] *  [[Larry Kudlow wkend]] *  ''On The House'' with the Carey Brothers and Rebecca Cole wkend *  [[The Best of Clark, Savage and Batchelor]] *  [[Words of New Hope Sun 4p wkend]]  ==History== KUGN first took the air on July 4, 1946 as the second radio station in Eugene, after [[KORE]]. KUGN was originally affiliated with the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] radio network, but switched to [[NBC]] in December 1952. The station dropped the longtime NBC affiliation for [[CBS]] in December 1977.  In 1953, KUGN raised its power to 5,000-watts, to become the most powerful radio station in Oregon, outside of the Portland-metro area.<ref>Register Guard, November 16, 1953</ref>  In 1979, KUGN began airing some [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] programming, including [[Monday Night Football]] and [[Larry King]]'s popular evening talk show.  During its first four decades, KUGN was best known for its eclectic, personable announcers. The careers of such veterans as Duke Young, Dick Cross, Dave Miller, Russ Doran, Skip Hathaway, Webb Russell, Wendy Ray and Dale \"Uncle Fuzzy\" Reed spanned the period from the late 1950s to the early 1970s.  The station had the first traffic reports in the market in 1976 when Ken Strobeck did morning and afternoon drive-time reports in the \"KUGN Traffic Rabbit,\" a Volkswagen Rabbit equipped with a radio telephone and portable transmitter. Tom Lichty (\"Major Tom\") took over the job in late 1976 when traffic reporting took to the air, serving both as traffic reporter and pilot.  The \"old\" KUGN, which Ray unabashedly called \"the best radio station in the world,\" is best remembered for its popular \"Morning Show.\" Reed, KUGN's resident Renaissance Man, teamed with Ray and news director Fred Webb for a much beloved program that was a \"must hear\" in the Eugene area throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s.  \"The Morning Show\" entertained \"The Listener\" with such lighthearted semi-regular features such as Ray's \"Ball Score Boogie,\" the \"Poet's Nook\" starring Webb as the high-buttoned poetry devotee \"Charles,\" Lichty's traffic reports, and \"Gridpute,\" a tongue-in-cheek Friday morning football preview featuring Ray and a clanking, cantankerous \"computer.\"  Ray and Webb also teamed up on Eugene's top-rated morning newscasts, twice hourly between 5:30 and 10 a.m. D.J.-anchor \"Uncle Fuzzy\" knit it all together with his wry commentary and savvy music choices (adult contemporary with a fair amount of jazz), delivered in a voice that was airwave-polished, yet that of Everyman.  Ray retired from radio in March 1992.  Reed and Webb continued until that November, but management chose not to renew their contracts.<ref>Register Guard, November 10, 1992</ref>  The station experimented with a few replacements, before settling on a morning news team of Ralph Steadman and Rick Little.  Steadman exited in 1995 to make way for [[University of Oregon]] sportscaster Jerry Allen.<ref>Register Guard, September 2, 1995</ref>  Since 2010, The KUGN Morning News has been co-hosted by Storm Kennedy and Grant McHill.  ==Ownership== KUGN-AM was founded in 1946 by C.H. Fisher of Portland.  After some years, his children - Carl Fisher, Jane Whitbread, and Nancy Harrison - assumed daily operations of the station.  In 1972 Obie Advertising bought KUGN from the Fishers.  Obie was headed by Brian Obie, a future mayor of Eugene.<ref>Register Guard, August 4, 1972</ref>  Obie Advertising sold KUGN to Dallas-based Media Corp. of America in 1987.  Then in mid-1989, long-time employees Jim Torrey (also a future mayor of Eugene) and Chuck Chackel purchased KUGN for $4.2 million<ref>Register Guard, June 8, 1989</ref> and formed Combined Communications.  Torrey sold his interest in the company in 1991.<ref>Register Guard, April 8, 1997</ref>  In 1996, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] changed radio station ownership rules to allow companies to own up to six stations in a market (see [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]]).  Prior to 1996, companies could only own two FM and two AM stations per market.  Combined Communications took advantage of the new ownership rules and sold the station in 1996 to Deschutes Broadcasting for $7 million.  Over the next three years, the station passed hands from Deschutes to Citadel Broadcasting to Marathon Media, and finally, to Cumulus Broadcasting.  Cumulus also purchased five other stations in the Eugene area.  ==\"Home of the Ducks\"== In 1957, KUGN became the first flagship station of the [[University of Oregon]] sports radio network, with play-by-play announcer John Tasnady serving five seasons as the football \"Voice of the Ducks.\" KUGN morning host Wendy Ray, already a veteran sportscaster, took the microphone in 1960 as the Ducks' basketball announcer, when KUGN got the broadcast rights to that sport from local rival KASH.  When Tasnady retired from broadcasting prior to the 1962 football season, Ray stepped in as football announcer, and called both sports up through the 1969 Oregon-Oregon State \"Civil War\" football game. Color commentator Mike Guldager stepped in as play-by-play announcer for the season finale at Hawaii, and then announced Ducks basketball and football until 1973.  Ray returned to Oregon Ducks play-by-play for one season (1974–75) as football and basketball announcer. He also served as color commentator for new play-by-play announcer Warren Swain in the 1980 football season. Outside of radio, Ray was the longtime public address announcer for Oregon track and field meets at Hayward Field.  Other KUGN \"voices\" of University of Oregon sports were Bud Sobel (1973–74), Ralph Petti (football, 1975), Mike Stone (1975–80), Swain (1980–82), Portland sportscaster Bill Johnson (1982–84) and Hal Ramey (1984–87).  KUGN lost the broadcast rights to Duck sports in 1987, when the [[University of Oregon]] athletic department set up its own in-house radio network. The university put the network's flagship status up for bidding, and local rival [[KPNW]] won out over KUGN.<ref>Register Guard, December 12, 1989</ref>  During that time, KUGN became the flagship station for the Oregon State Beavers radio network, outbidding Portland station [[KEX-AM]].<ref>Register Guard, May 3, 1987</ref>  Eight years later, KUGN regained the broadcast rights to Duck sports. Play-by-play announcer Jerry Allen moved from KPNW to KUGN at that time.  Allen, a native Oregonian and veteran sportscaster, will begin his 28th season as \"Voice of the Ducks\" in the fall of 2014.  ==Former anchors and reporters== * [[Lars Larson]] * [[Delilah Rene]] * [[Joe Giansante]] * [[Wendy Ray]] * [[Dale \"Uncle Fuzzy\" Reed]] * [[Fred Webb]] * Bob Anderson * Mark Armstrong * Kristin Bailey * Tracy Berry * Jack Billings * Don Bishoff * Bob Boche * [[Dan Carlin]] * Dick Cross * Barbara Dellenback * Russ Doran * Brittany Durbin * Frank \"The Old Trader\" Ellington * Sarah Ferren * Jack Flemming * Russ Francis * [[Mike Guldager]] * Lester B.

It first appeared in [[Ishirō Honda]]'s 1954 film ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]''. Since then, Godzilla has gone on to become a worldwide pop culture icon, appearing in numerous media including [[Godzilla video games|video games]], novels, [[Godzilla (comics)|comic books]], [[Godzilla (franchise)#Television|television shows]], 28 films produced by [[Toho]]  and [[Godzilla_(franchise)#American_films|two Hollywood films]]. The character is commonly alluded to by the title '''King of the Monsters''', a phrase first used in ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]'', the Americanized version of Honda's original 1954 film.  With the [[nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru|Lucky Dragon 5]]'' incident still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, Godzilla was conceived as a metaphor for [[nuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|Brothers|2009|p=}} As the film series expanded, some stories took on less serious undertones portraying Godzilla as a hero while other plots still portrayed Godzilla as a destructive monster; sometimes the lesser of two threats who plays the defender by default but is still a danger to humanity.  ==Overview==  ===Name=== {{nihongo|''Gojira''|ゴジラ}} is a [[portmanteau]] of the Japanese words: {{nihongo3|\"[[gorilla]]\"|ゴリラ|gorira}}, and {{nihongo3|\"[[whale]]\"|鯨（クジラ）|kujira}}, which is fitting because in one planning stage, Godzilla was described as \"a cross between a gorilla and a whale\",{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=22}} alluding to his size, power and aquatic origin. One popular story is that \"Gojira\" was actually the nickname of a corpulent stagehand at Toho Studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.godzillaondvd.com/mediapageloads/still05.html |title=Gojira Media |work=Godzila Gojimm |publisher=Toho Co., Ltd. |accessdate=November 19, 2010 }}</ref> Kimi Honda, the widow of the director, dismissed this in a 1998 BBC documentary devoted to Godzilla, \"The backstage boys at Toho loved to joke around with tall stories\".{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=23}}   Godzilla's name was written in [[ateji]] as {{nihongo3||呉爾羅|Gojira}}, where the [[kanji]] are used for phonetic value and not for meaning.

Taking inspiration from ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', special effects artist [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] had initially wanted Godzilla to be portrayed via stop-motion, but prohibitive deadlines and a lack of experienced animators in Japan at the time made suitmation more practical. The first suit consisted of a body cavity made of thin wires and bamboo wrapped in chicken wire for support, and covered in fabric and cushions, which were then coated in latex. The first suit was held together by small hooks on the back, though subsequent Godzilla suits incorporated a zipper. Its weight was in excess of {{convert|100|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"godziszewski\"/> Prior to 1984, most Godzilla suits were made from scratch, thus resulting in slight design changes in each film appearance.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=16-17}} The most notable changes during the 1960s-70s were the reduction in Godzilla's number of toes and the removal of the character's external ears and prominent fangs, features which would later be reincorporated in the Godzilla designs from ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'' (1984) onwards.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=163-164}} The most consistent Godzilla design was maintained from ''[[Godzilla vs Biollante]]'' (1989) to ''[[Godzilla vs Destoroyah]]'' (1995), when the suit was given a cat-like face and double rows of teeth.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=254-257}} Several suit actors had difficulties in performing as Godzilla, due to the suits' weight, lack of ventilation and diminished visibility.<ref name=\"godziszewski\"/> [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] in particular, who portrayed Godzilla from 1984 to 1995, described how the Godzilla suits he wore were even heavier and hotter than their predecessors, because of the incorporation of animatronics.<ref name=\"clements2010\">Clements, J.

The suits were similar to those used in the Toho films, with the actors' heads being located in the monster's neck region, and the facial movements controlled via animatronics. However, because of the creature's horizontal posture, the stuntmen had to wear metal leg extenders, which allowed them to stand six feet off the ground with their feet bent forward.

She is the author of seven novels, including ''[[Adam Bede]]'' (1859), ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'' (1860), ''[[Silas Marner]]'' (1861), ''[[Middlemarch]]'' (1871–72), and ''[[Daniel Deronda]]'' (1876), most of them set in provincial England and known for their [[realism (arts)|realism]] and psychological insight.  She used a male pen name, she said, to ensure her works would be taken seriously. Female authors were published under their own names during Eliot's life, but she wanted to escape the stereotype of women only writing lighthearted romances. She also wished to have her fiction judged separately from her already extensive and widely known work as an editor and critic. An additional factor in her use of a pen name may have been a desire to shield her private life from public scrutiny and to prevent scandals attending her relationship with the married [[George Henry Lewes]], with whom she lived for over 20 years.<ref>Karl, Frederick R.

She was the second child of Robert Evans (1773–1849) and Christiana Evans (''née'' Pearson, 1788–1836), the daughter of a local mill-owner. Mary Ann's name was sometimes shortened to Marian.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/collections/projects/eliot/middlemarch/bio.html#mary University of Virginia] According to a University of Virginia research forum published here, her baptismal records record the spelling as Mary-Anne, and she uses this spelling in her earliest letters. Around 1857, she began to use Mary Ann. In 1859, she was using Marian, but she reverted to Mary Ann in 1880.  {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/collections/projects/eliot/middlemarch/bio.html#mary |date=20150322162719 }}</ref> Her full siblings were Christiana, known as Chrissey (1814–59), Isaac (1816–1890), and twin brothers who survived a few days in March 1821. She also had a half-brother, Robert (1802–64), and half-sister, Fanny (1805–82), from her father's previous marriage to Harriet Poynton (?1780–1809). Robert Evans, of Welsh ancestry, was the manager of the [[Arbury Hall]] Estate for the [[Newdigate family]] in Warwickshire, and Mary Ann was born on the estate at South Farm. In early 1820 the family moved to a house named Griff, between [[Nuneaton]] and [[Bedworth]].  The young Evans was obviously intelligent and a voracious reader. Because she was not considered physically beautiful, and thus not thought to have much chance of marriage, and because of her intelligence, her father invested in an education not often afforded women.<ref>Karl, Frederick R. ''George Eliot: Voice of a Century''. Norton, 1995. pp. 24–25</ref> From ages five to nine, she boarded with her sister Chrissey at Miss Latham's school in [[Attleborough, Warwickshire|Attleborough]], from ages nine to thirteen at Mrs. Wallington's school in Nuneaton, and from ages thirteen to sixteen at Miss Franklin's school in Coventry. At Mrs. Wallington's school, she was taught by the [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Maria Lewis—to whom her earliest surviving letters are addressed. In the religious atmosphere of the Miss Franklin's school, Evans was exposed to a quiet, disciplined belief opposed to evangelicalism.<ref>Karl, Frederick R. ''George Eliot: Voice of a Century''. Norton, 1995. p. 31</ref>  After age sixteen, Evans had little formal education.<ref>Karl, Frederick R. George ''Eliot: Voice of a Century.''  Norton, 1995. p. 52</ref> Thanks to her father's important role on the estate, she was allowed access to the library of Arbury Hall, which greatly aided her self-education and breadth of learning. Her classical education left its mark; Christopher Stray has observed that \"George Eliot's novels draw heavily on Greek literature (only one of her books can be printed correctly without the use of a Greek typeface), and her themes are often influenced by Greek tragedy\".<ref>Christopher Stray ''Classics Transformed'', p. 81</ref> Her frequent visits to the estate also allowed her to contrast the wealth in which the local landowner lived with the lives of the often much poorer people on the estate, and different lives lived in parallel would reappear in many of her works. The other important early influence in her life was religion. She was brought up within a [[low church]] [[Anglican]] family, but at that time the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] was an area with a growing number of [[English Dissenters|religious dissenters]].  === Move to Coventry === In 1836 her mother died and Evans (then 16) returned home to act as housekeeper, but she continued correspondence with her tutor Maria Lewis. When she was 21, her brother Isaac married and took over the family home, so Evans and her father moved to [[Foleshill]] near [[Coventry]]. The closeness to Coventry society brought new influences, most notably those of Charles and Cara Bray. [[Charles Bray]] had become rich as a ribbon manufacturer and had used his wealth in the building of schools and in other philanthropic causes. Evans, who had been struggling with religious doubts for some time, became intimate friends with the progressive, free-thinking Brays, whose \"Rosehill\" home was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. The people whom the young woman met at the Brays' house included [[Robert Owen]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Harriet Martineau]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal theologies and to writers such as [[David Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical stories. In fact, her first major literary work was an English translation of Strauss's ''The Life of Jesus'' (1846), which she completed after it had been left incomplete by another member of the \"Rosehill Circle\". As a product of their friendship, Bray published some of Evans's earliest writing, such as reviews, in his newspaper the ''[[Coventry Herald and Observer]]''.<ref name = Eliot>{{cite journal| article =George Eliot's Earliest Prose: The Coventry \"Herald\" and the Coventry Fiction| first =Kathleen | last= McCormick| journal =Victorian Periodicals Review| volume = 19| number = 2 | date = Summer 1986| pages = 57–62| jstor =20082202}}</ref>  When Evans began to question her religious faith, her father threatened to throw her out of the house, but his threat was not carried out. Instead, she respectfully attended church and continued to keep house for him until his death in 1849, when she was 30. Five days after her father's funeral, she travelled to Switzerland with the Brays. She decided to stay on in [[Geneva]] alone, living first on the lake at Plongeon (near the present-day United Nations buildings) and then on the second floor of a house owned by her friends François and Juliet d'Albert Durade on the rue de Chanoines (now the rue de la Pelisserie). She commented happily that, \"one feels in a downy nest high up in a good old tree\". Her stay is commemorated by a plaque on the building. While residing there, she read avidly and took long walks in the beautiful Swiss countryside, which was a great inspiration to her. François Durade painted her portrait there as well.<ref>Hardy BN. ''George Elliot: A Critic's Biography''. Continuum. London 2006 pp42-45.</ref>  === Move to London and editorship of the ''Westminster Review'' === On her return to England the following year (1850), she moved to London with the intent of becoming a writer, and she began referring to herself as Marian Evans. She stayed at the house of [[John Chapman (publisher)|John Chapman]], the radical publisher whom she had met earlier at Rosehill and who had published her Strauss translation. Chapman had recently purchased the campaigning, left-wing journal ''[[The Westminster Review]]'', and Evans became its assistant editor in 1851. Although Chapman was officially the editor, it was Evans who did most of the work of producing the journal, contributing many essays and reviews beginning with the January 1852 issue and continuing until the end of her employment at the Review in the first half of 1854.<ref>Ashton, Rosemary. ''George Eliot: A Life''. London: Penguin, 1997. 88ff. p110.</ref>  Women writers were common at the time, but Evans's role as the female editor of a literary magazine was quite unusual. She was not considered to be a beautiful or even an attractive woman. According to Henry James, ''She had a low forehead, a dull grey eye, a vast pendulous nose, a huge mouth full of uneven teeth and a chin and jawbone 'qui n'en finissent pas'... Now in this vast ugliness resides a most powerful beauty which, in a very few minutes, steals forth and charms the mind, so that you end, as I ended, in falling in love with her. Yes, behold me in love with this great horse-faced bluestocking.''<ref> Henry James, in a letter to his father, published in Edel, Leon (ed.) ''Henry James: Selected Letters'' (1990)</ref> During this period she formed a number of embarrassing, unreciprocated emotional attachments, including one with Chapman (who was married but lived with both his wife and his mistress), and another with [[Herbert Spencer]].  === Relationship with George Lewes === [[File:George Eliot by Samuel Laurence.jpg|thumb|Portrait of George Eliot by [[Samuel Laurence]], c. 1860]]  The philosopher and critic [[George Henry Lewes]] (1817–78) met Evans in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes was already married to Agnes Jervis. They had an [[open marriage]], and in addition to the three children they had together, Agnes also had four children by [[Thornton Leigh Hunt]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Henry|first= Nancy|title= The Cambridge Introduction to George Eliot|year= 2008|publisher= Cambridge|location= Cambridge|pages=6}}</ref> Because Lewes allowed himself to be falsely named as the father on the birth certificates of Jervis's illegitimate children, he was considered to be complicit in adultery, and therefore he was not legally able to divorce her.  In July 1854, Lewes and Evans travelled to [[Weimar]] and Berlin together for the purpose of research. Before going to Germany, Evans continued her theological work with a translation of Feuerbach's ''Essence of Christianity'', and while abroad she wrote essays and worked on her translation of [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', which she completed in 1856, but which was not published in her lifetime.<ref>Hughes, Kathryn, ''George Eliot: The Last Victorian'', p. 168.</ref>  The trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon for Evans and Lewes, and they now considered themselves married, with Evans calling herself Marian Evans Lewes, and referring to Lewes as her husband. It was not unusual for men and women in Victorian society to have affairs; [[Charles Bray]], John Chapman, [[Friedrich Engels]], and [[Wilkie Collins]] all had extra-marital relationships, though they were much more discreet than Lewes and Evans were. It was this lack of discretion and their public admission of the relationship which created accusations of polygamy and earned them the moral disapproval of English society .  === First publication === [[File:George Eliot BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph ([[:en:albumen print|albumen print]]) of George Eliot, c. 1865]] While continuing to contribute pieces to the ''Westminster Review'', Evans resolved to become a novelist, and she set out a manifesto for herself in one of her last essays for the ''Review'', \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\"<ref>[http://webscript.princeton.edu/~mnoble/eliot-texts/eliot-sillynovels.html \"Silly Novels by Lady Novelists\"] text from ''The Westminster Review'' Vol. 66 old series, Vol. 10 new series (October 1856): 442–61.</ref> (1856). The essay criticised the trivial and ridiculous plots of contemporary fiction by women. In other essays, she praised the [[realism (arts)|realism]] of novels that were being written in Europe at the time, and it became clear in her subsequent fiction that she placed an emphasis on realistic storytelling. She also adopted a nom-de-plume, the one for which she would become known: George Eliot. This pen-name was said by some to be an homage to George Lewes. In addition to adopting his first name, the last name, Eliot, could possibly have been a code for \"to L&mdash;I owe it\".<ref>Mead, Rebecca, ''My Life in Middlemarch''. New York: Crown Publishers, 2014, p. 178</ref>  In 1857, when she was 37, \"The Sad Fortunes of the Reverend Amos Barton\", the first of the ''[[Scenes of Clerical Life]]'', was published in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' and, along with the other ''Scenes'', it was well received (it was published in book form early in 1858). Her first complete novel, published in 1859, was ''[[Adam Bede]]''; it was an instant success, but it prompted intense interest in who this new author might be. ''Scenes of Clerical Life'' was widely believed to have been written by a country [[parson]] or perhaps the wife of a parson. With the release of the incredibly popular ''Adam Bede'', speculation increased, and there was even a pretender to the authorship, one Joseph Liggins. In the end, the real George Eliot stepped forward: Marian Evans Lewes admitted she was the author. The revelations about Eliot's private life surprised and shocked many of her admiring readers, but this did not affect her popularity as a novelist. Eliot's relationship with Lewes afforded her the encouragement and stability she so badly needed to write fiction, and to ease her self-doubt, but it would be some time before they were accepted into polite society. Acceptance was finally confirmed in 1877 when they were introduced to [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]], the daughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. The queen herself was an avid reader of all of George Eliot's novels and was so impressed with ''Adam Bede'' that she commissioned the artist [[Edward Henry Corbould]] to paint scenes from the book.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/6794 Rosemary Ashton, \"Evans, Marian &#91;George Eliot&#93; (1819–1880)\"], (Later Works) ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2008</ref>  [[File:George Eliot 31 Wimbledon Park Road blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, Holly Lodge, 31 Wimbledon Park Road, London]] After the success of ''Adam Bede'', Eliot continued to write popular novels for the next fifteen years. Within a year of completing ''Adam Bede'', she finished ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'', dedicating the manuscript: \"To my beloved husband, George Henry Lewes, I give this MS. of my third book, written in the sixth year of our life together, at Holly Lodge, South Field, Wandsworth, and finished 21 March 1860.\"  Her last novel was ''[[Daniel Deronda]]'', published in 1876, after which she and Lewes moved to [[Witley]], Surrey. By this time Lewes's health was failing, and he died two years later, on 30 November 1878. Eliot spent the next two years editing Lewes's final work, ''Life and Mind'', for publication, and she found solace and companionship with [[John Walter Cross]]<ref>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/John_Walter_Cross</ref>, a Scottish commission agent<ref>1881 census</ref> whose mother had recently died.  === Marriage to John Cross and death === [[File:Eliot George grave.jpg|thumb|Eliot's grave in [[Highgate Cemetery]]]]  On 16 May 1880 Eliot courted controversy once more by marrying John Cross, a man twenty years her junior, and again changing her name, this time to Mary Anne Cross. The legal marriage at least pleased her brother Isaac, who had broken off relations with her when she had begun to live with Lewes, but now sent congratulations. While the couple was honeymooning in Venice, Cross, in a fit of depression, jumped from the hotel balcony into the Grand Canal. He survived, and the newlyweds returned to England. They moved to a new house in Chelsea, but Eliot fell ill with a throat infection. This, coupled with the kidney disease she had been afflicted with for several years, led to her death on 22 December 1880 at the age of 61.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/eliot_george.shtml| title = George Eliot | date = 15 October 2009| accessdate =30 December 2009| publisher=BBC History}}</ref>  Eliot was not buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] because of her denial of the Christian faith and her \"irregular\" though monogamous life with Lewes. She was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]] (East), Highgate, London, in the area reserved for religious dissenters and agnostics, beside the love of her life, [[George Henry Lewes]]; Karl Marx's grave is nearby. In 1980, on the centenary of her death, a memorial stone was established for her in the [[Poets' Corner]].  Several buildings in her birthplace of Nuneaton are named after her or titles of her novels. These include The George Eliot School (previously George Eliot Community School) and Middlemarch Junior School. In 1948, Nuneaton Emergency Hospital was renamed George Eliot Hospital in her honour.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=187-cr2765&cid=0#0 Nuneaton Emergency Hospital at the National Archives]</ref> George Eliot Road, in [[Foleshill]], Coventry was also named in her honour and Nuneaton motorcycle manufacturer [[John Birch (engineer)|John Birch]] named one of his motorcycles after her.  A statue of Eliot is in Newdegate Street, Nuneaton, and [[Nuneaton Museum & Art Gallery]] has a display of artifacts related to her.  ==Literary assessment== [[File:George Eliot 7.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Frederick William Burton]], 1864]]  Throughout her career, Eliot wrote with a politically astute pen. From ''[[Adam Bede]]'' to ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]'' and ''[[Silas Marner]]'', Eliot presented the cases of social outsiders and small-town persecution. ''[[Felix Holt, the Radical]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Jubal]]'' were overtly political, and political crisis is at the heart of ''[[Middlemarch]]'', in which she presents the stories of a number of denizens of a small English town on the eve of the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill of 1832]]; the novel is notable for its deep psychological insight and sophisticated character portraits. The roots of her realist philosophy can be found in her review of [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Modern Painters]]'' in ''[[Westminster Review]]'' in 1856.  Readers in the Victorian era particularly praised her books for their depictions of rural society, for which she drew on her own early experiences, and she shared with [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] the belief that there was much interest and importance in the mundane details of ordinary country lives. Eliot did not, however, confine herself to her [[bucolic]] roots. ''[[Romola]]'', a historical novel set in late 15th century [[Florence]] and touching on the lives of several real persons such as the priest [[Girolamo Savonarola]], displays her wider reading and interests. In ''The Spanish Gypsy'', Eliot made a foray into verse, creating a work whose initial popularity has not endured.  The religious elements in her fiction also owe much to her upbringing, with the experiences of Maggie Tulliver from ''The Mill on the Floss'' sharing many similarities with the young Mary Ann Evans's own development. When Silas Marner is persuaded that his alienation from the church means also his alienation from society, the author's life is again mirrored with her refusal to attend church. She was at her most autobiographical in ''Looking Backwards'', part of her final printed work ''[[Impressions of Theophrastus Such]]''. By the time of ''[[Daniel Deronda]]'', Eliot's sales were falling off, and she faded from public view to some degree. This was not helped by the biography written by her husband after her death, which portrayed a wonderful, almost saintly, woman totally at odds with the scandalous life people knew she had led. In the 20th century she was championed by a new breed of critics, most notably by [[Virginia Woolf]], who called ''Middlemarch'' \"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people\".<ref>Woolf, Virginia. \"George Eliot.\" ''The Common Reader''.

Heliox is a medical treatment for patients with difficulty breathing.  The mixture generates less resistance than atmospheric air when passing through the airways of the lungs, and thus requires less effort by a patient to breathe in and out of the lungs.  Heliox has been used medically since the 1930s, and although the medical community adopted it initially to alleviate symptoms of upper airway obstruction, its range of medical uses has since expanded greatly, mostly because of the low density of the gas.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barach AL, Eckman M |title=THE EFFECTS OF INHALATION OF HELIUM MIXED WITH OXYGEN ON THE MECHANICS OF RESPIRATION |journal=J.

It does this by two mechanisms: # increased tendency to [[laminar flow]]; # reduced resistance in [[turbulent flow]]. Heliox has a similar viscosity to air but a significantly lower density (0.5&nbsp;g/l versus 1.2&nbsp;5g/l at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]]). Flow of gas through the airway comprises laminar flow, transitional flow and turbulent flow. The tendency for each type of flow is described by the [[Reynolds number]]. Heliox's low density produces a lower Reynolds number and hence higher probability of laminar flow for any given airway. Laminar flow tends to generate less resistance than turbulent flow.  In the small airways where flow is laminar, resistance is proportional to gas viscosity and is not related to density and so heliox has little effect. The [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation]] describes laminar resistance. In the large airways where flow is turbulent, resistance is proportional to density, so heliox has a significant effect.  Heliox has been used medically since the early 1930s. It was the mainstay of treatment in acute [[asthma]] before the advent of [[bronchodilators]]. Currently, heliox is mainly used in conditions of large airway narrowing (upper airway obstruction from tumors or foreign bodies and [[vocal cord dysfunction]]). There is also some use of heliox in conditions of the medium airways ([[croup]], asthma and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]).  Patients with these conditions may suffer a range of symptoms including [[dyspnea]] (breathlessness), hypoxemia (below-normal oxygen content in the arterial blood) and eventually a weakening of the respiratory muscles due to [[exhaustion]], which can lead to respiratory failure and require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Heliox may reduce all these effects, making it easier for the patient to breathe.<ref name=\"BOCMdata\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bocmedical.co.uk/product_information/Medical_Helium_Oxygen_Mix_172.pdf |title=Heliox data sheet |author=BOC Medical}}</ref> Heliox has also found utility in the weaning of patients off mechanical ventilation, and in the nebulization of inhalable drugs, particularly for the elderly.<ref name=\"AnaesUK\">{{cite journal |author=Lee DL, Hsu CW, Lee H, Chang HW, Huang YC |title=Beneficial effects of albuterol therapy driven by heliox versus by oxygen in severe asthma exacerbation |journal=Acad Emerg Med |volume=12 |issue=9 |pages=820–7 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16141015 |doi=10.1197/j.aem.2005.04.020 |url=http://www.anaesthesiauk.com/article.aspx?articleid=100375 |accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> Research has also indicated advantages in using helium–oxygen mixtures in delivery of [[anaesthesia]].<ref name=\"BJA\">{{cite journal |author=Buczkowski PW, Fombon FN, Russell WC, Thompson JP |title=Effects of helium on high frequency jet ventilation in model of airway stenosis |journal=Br J Anaesth |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=701–5 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16143576 |doi=10.1093/bja/aei229 |url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16143576 |accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref>  == Diving uses == {{Listen|right|filename=Helium article read with helium.ogg|title=Effect of helium on a human voice|description=The effect of helium on a human voice|format=[[Ogg]]}}  Owing to the expense of helium,<ref name=\"Fills\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fillexpress.com/fills.shtml#prices |title=Example pricing for filling cylinders |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> heliox is most likely to be used in deep [[commercial diving]]. It is also sometimes used by diving enthusiasts, particularly those using [[rebreather]]s, which conserve the breathing gas at depth much better than [[open circuit scuba]].

''[[I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings]]'', released in November 2001, featured performances of seven songs from ''Kid A'' and ''Amnesiac'' along with the acoustic, previously unreleased \"True Love Waits\".  ===2002–04: ''Hail to the Thief'' and departure from EMI=== {{Listen  | filename=Radiohead - 2 + 2 = 5 (sample).ogg  | title=\"2 + 2 = 5\"  | description=An up-tempo, guitar-driven album opener, \"2 + 2 = 5\" heralded Radiohead's return to a more straightforward [[alternative rock]] style that still included electronic elements. }}  During July and August 2002, Radiohead toured Portugal and Spain, playing a number of newly written songs.

Cartoons#1933-1944: Leon Schlesinger Productions|Leon Schlesinger Studios]], which later became the [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] studio, during the [[Golden Age of American animation]]. He was also a distant relative of the Warner Brothers. As head of his own studio, Schlesinger served as the producer of Warner's ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoons from 1933, when Schlesinger assumed production from his subcontractors, [[Harman-Ising]], to 1944, when Warner acquired the studio.  ==Early life and career== Schlesinger was born in [[Philadelphia]]. After working at a theater as an usher, songbook agent, actor, and manager (including the [[Palace Theater (New York City)|Palace Theater]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]),<ref>''[[The Buffalo News]]'', April 15, 1944</ref> he founded [[Pacific Title & Art Studio]] in 1919, where most of his business was producing title cards for [[silent film]]s. As talking pictures (\"[[talkie]]s\")  replaced them in 1929 and 1930, Schlesinger looked for ways to capitalize on the new technology and stay in business. Some [[film historian]]s claim that he helped finance the Warner Brothers' first talkie, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927). He then secured a contract with the studio to produce its brand-new ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' series, and he signed [[animator]]s [[Hugh Harman]] and [[Rudy Ising]] to create these cartoons with their [[Bosko]] character as the star.  ==Schlesinger as businessman== Schlesinger was a shrewd businessman with a keen eye for talent. When Harman and Ising left Warner Bros. with Bosko in 1934, Schlesinger set up his own studio on the Warner Bros. [[Sunset Boulevard]] lot at the corner of Van Ness and Fernwood. He wooed animators away from other studios, including some of those who had departed with Harman and Ising including [[Bob Clampett]]. One of these was [[Friz Freleng]], whom Schlesinger promoted to oversee production of ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and to develop the sister series, ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''. Freleng's talent quickly shone through, and Schlesinger's hiring of [[Tex Avery]], [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Frank Tashlin]] further increased the quality of the studio's output. He later added [[Carl Stalling]] and [[Mel Blanc]], and collectively these men created such famous characters as [[Porky Pig]], [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Bugs Bunny]]. Schlesinger largely took a \"hands off\" approach to the animation unit, allowing his directors freedom to create what they wished, provided that the resulting films were successful. Schlesinger sold [[Pacific Title & Art Studio]] in 1935 to concentrate on his animation studio.  ===Business practices=== Schlesinger's hard-nosed business practices cannot be overstated. His animators worked in a dilapidated studio (Avery's unit were briefly assigned to a bungalow they dubbed \"[[Termite Terrace]]\"), and Schlesinger briefly shut down the studio in mid-1941 when unionized employees demanded a pay raise. On another occasion, he boycotted the [[Academy Awards]] for what he claimed was preferential treatment for the [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Walt Disney]] and [[MGM cartoon studio]]s. He also farmed some of the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' out to his brother-in-law, Ray Katz, for tax breaks.  Schlesinger was also known (among his animators, at least) for his [[lisp (speech)|lisp]]. One oft-repeated \"official\" story states that [[Mel Blanc]] patterned the voices of both Daffy Duck and [[Sylvester the cat]] on Schlesinger. However, in Mel Blanc's autobiography, ''That's Not All Folks!'', he contradicts that conventional belief, writing \"It seemed to me that such an extended mandible would hinder his speech, particularly on words containing an ''s'' sound. Thus 'despicable' became 'des''th''picable'.\" Daffy's slobbery, exaggerated lisp was developed over time.  Animators who worked with Schlesinger also found him conceited and somewhat [[wikt:foppish|foppish]], wearing too much cologne and dressing like a dandy.  ==Appearances in shorts== Leon Schlesinger appeared as himself in Freleng's short ''[[You Ought to Be in Pictures]]'' (1940), one that combines live action with animation. In this short, Mel Blanc voices Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and all other characters, except Schlesinger who dubbed his voice because the studio did not have a sound camera. As with other Warner cartoon staffers, Schlesinger appeared in caricature form in such cartoons as ''[[Hollywood Steps Out]]'', ''[[Russian Rhapsody (film)|Russian Rhapsody]]'' and ''[[Nutty News]]''.  ==Later life and career== Schlesinger remained head of the animation studio until 1944 when he sold his assets to Warner Bros. He continued to market the characters and headed Warners' Theater Services unit<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=h_UDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA113&dq=%22leon+schlesinger%22#v=onepage&q=%22leon%20schlesinger%22&f=false | title = Billboard | author1 = Nielsen Business Media | first1 = Inc | date = February 7, 1948}}</ref> until his death from a viral infection on Christmas Day, 1949 at the age of 65. Schlesinger also produced a number of [[B-movie]] [[Western movie|Westerns]] in the 1930s. After Warner Bros. bought Schlesinger's studio, [[Eddie Selzer]] assumed Schlesinger's position as producer. Schlesinger was an avid racehorse fan and was a director of the Western Harness Racing Association. A United Press dispatch dated January 10, 1950, reported a director had been found to fill the vacancy caused by his death. He is interred in the Beth Olam Mausoleum inside the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in Hollywood, California.<ref>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=8776</ref>  ==References== {{Reflist}}  ==External links== {{Commons category}} *{{IMDb name|0772266}}  {{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}} {{Authority control}}  {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]] --> |NAME= Schlesinger, Leon |ALTERNATIVE NAMES= |SHORT DESCRIPTION=Film producer |DATE OF BIRTH= May 20, 1884 |PLACE OF BIRTH= [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, US |DATE OF DEATH= December 25, 1949 |PLACE OF DEATH= Los Angeles }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Schlesinger, Leon}} [[Category:1884 births]] [[Category:1949 deaths]] [[Category:American film producers]] [[Category:American film studio executives]] [[Category:American people of German descent]] [[Category:American television producers]] [[Category:Burials at Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] [[Category:Businesspeople from Los Angeles, California]] [[Category:Businesspeople from New York]] [[Category:Businesspeople from Pennsylvania]] [[Category:People from Buffalo, New York|Schlesinger,Leon]]</td></tr><tr><td>It Can't Happen Here</td><td>201227</td><td>683116386</td><td>2015-09-28T07:01:59.000+0000</td><td>SialhCascadia</td><td>26374402</td><td>{{Other uses|Can't Happen Here (disambiguation)}} {{italic title}} {{Infobox book| <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books --> | name           = It Can't Happen Here | image          = File:ItCantHappenHere.jpg | caption        = First edition | author         = [[Sinclair Lewis]] | cover_artist   = | country        = [[United States]] | language       = [[English language|English]] | series         =  | genre          = [[Political fiction]] | publisher      = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran and Company]] | release_date   = 1935 | media_type     = Print ([[Hardcover]]) | pages          = 458 pp. | isbn           =  045121658X | preceded_by    =  | followed_by    =  }}  '''''It Can't Happen Here''''' is a semi-satirical 1935 [[political fiction|political novel]] by American author [[Sinclair Lewis]]. Published during the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe, the novel describes the rise of Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip, a populist [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] who is elected to the [[President of the United States|presidency]] after promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and traditional values. After his election, Windrip takes complete control of the government and imposes a [[plutocratic]]/[[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force, in the manner of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. The novel's plot centers on journalist Doremus Jessup's opposition to the new regime and his subsequent struggle against it as part of a liberal rebellion. Reviewers at the time, and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the connection with Louisiana politician [[Huey Long]], who was preparing to run for president in the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 election]] when he was assassinated in 1935 just prior to the novel's publication.  ==Plot summary== In 1936 Senator Berzelius \"Buzz\" Windrip, a charismatic and power-hungry politician, wins the election as [[President of the United States]] on a [[populism|populist]] platform, promising to restore the country to prosperity and greatness, and promising each citizen $5,000 a year (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5000|1935|r=-4}}}}, [[adjusted for inflation]]{{inflation-fn|US}}). Portraying himself as a champion of traditional American values, Windrip easily defeats his opponents, Senator Walt Trowbridge and President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. Though having previously foreshadowed some [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] measures in order to reorganize the United States government, Windrip rapidly outlaws dissent, incarcerates political enemies in concentration camps, and trains and arms a [[paramilitary]] force called the Minute Men, who terrorize citizens and enforce the policies of Windrip and his \"corporatist\" regime. One of his first acts as president is to eliminate the influence of the [[United States Congress]], which draws the ire of many citizens as well as the legislators themselves. The Minute Men respond to protests against Windrip's decisions harshly, attacking demonstrators with bayonets. In addition to these actions, Windrip's administration, known as the \"Corpo\" government, curtails women's and minority rights, and eliminates individual states by subdividing the country into administrative sectors. The government of these sectors is managed by \"Corpo\" authorities, usually prominent businessmen or Minute Men officers. Those accused of crimes against the government appear before [[kangaroo court]]s presided over by \"military judges\".  Despite these dictatorial (and \"quasi-draconian\") measures, a majority of Americans approve of them, seeing them as necessary though painful steps to restore American power. Others, those less enthusiastic about the prospect of [[corporatism]], reassure themselves that fascism cannot \"happen here\"; hence the novel's title.  Open opponents of Windrip, led by Senator Trowbridge, form an organization called the New Underground, helping dissidents escape to Canada in manners reminiscent of the [[Underground Railroad]] and distributing anti-Windrip propaganda. One recruit to the New Underground is Doremus Jessup, the novel's protagonist, a traditional [[social liberalism|liberal]] and an opponent of both Corpoism and communist theories, which Windrip's administration suppresses. Jessup's participation in the organization results in the publication of a periodical called ''The Vermont Vigilance'', in which he writes editorials decrying Windrip's abuses of power. Shad Ledue, the local district commissioner and Jessup's former hired man, resents his old employer and eventually discovers his actions, having him sent to a concentration camp. Ledue subsequently terrorizes Jessup's family and particularly his daughter Sissy, whom he unsuccessfully attempts to seduce. Sissy does, however, discover evidence of corrupt dealings on the part of Ledue, which she exposes to Francis Tasbrough, a one-time friend of Jessup and Ledue's superior in the administrative hierarchy. Tasbrough has Ledue imprisoned in the same camp as Jessup, where inmates he had sent there organize his murder. Jessup escapes - after a relatively brief incarceration - when his friends bribe one of the camp guards. He flees to Canada, where he rejoins the New Underground. He later serves the organization as a spy in the northeastern United States, passing along information and urging locals to resist Windrip.  In time, Windrip's hold on power weakens as the economic prosperity he promised does not materialize and increased numbers of disillusioned Americans, including Vice President Perley Beecroft, flee to Canada or Mexico. He also angers his Secretary of State, Lee Sarason, who had served earlier as his chief political operative and adviser. Sarason and Windrip's other lieutenants, including General Dewey Haik, seize power and exile the president to France. Sarason succeeds Windrip, but his extravagant and relatively weak rule creates a power vacuum in which Haik and others vie for power. In a bloody putsch, Haik leads a party of military supporters into the White House, kills Sarason and his associates, and proclaims himself president. The two coups cause a slow erosion of Corpo power, and Haik's government desperately tries to arouse patriotism by launching an unjustified invasion of Mexico. After slandering Mexico in state-run newspapers, Haik orders a mass conscription of young American men for the invasion of that country, infuriating many who had until then been staunch Corpo loyalists. Riots and rebellions break out across the country, with many realizing that the Corpos have misled them.  General Emmanuel Coon, among Haik's senior officers, defects to the opposition with a large portion of his army, giving strength to the resistance movement. Though Haik remains in control of much of the country, civil war soon breaks out as the resistance tries to consolidate its grasp on the Midwest. The novel ends after the beginning of the conflict, with Jessup working as an agent for the New Underground in Corpo-occupied portions of southern Minnesota.  ==Reception== [[File:Sinclair Lewis It Can't Happen Here 1936 theater poster.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Poster for the stage adaptation of ''It Can't Happen Here'', October 27, 1936 at the Lafayette Theater as part of the [[Detroit]] [[Federal Theater Project|Federal Theater]]]] Reviewers at the time of the book's publication, and literary critics ever since, have emphasized the connection with Louisiana politician [[Huey Long]], who was preparing to run for president in 1936.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=62}} According to Boulard (1998), \"the most chilling and uncanny treatment of Huey by a writer came with Sinclair Lewis's ''It Can't Happen Here''.\"{{sfn|Boulard|1998|p=115}} Lewis portrayed a genuine American dictator on the Hitler model.

Lewis had the goal of hurting Long's chances in the 1936 election.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=62}} Keith Perry argues that the key weakness of the novel is not that he decks out American politicians with sinister European touches, but that he finally conceives of fascism and totalitarianism in terms of traditional American political models rather than seeing them as introducing a new kind of society and a new kind of regime.{{sfn|Perry|2004}} Windrip is less a Nazi than a con-man-plus-[[Rotary Club|Rotarian]], a manipulator who knows how to appeal to people's desperation, but neither he nor his followers are in the grip of the kind of world-transforming ideology like Hitler's [[National Socialism]].<ref>See also {{harvnb|Lingeman|2005|pp=400–408}}</ref>  ==Adaptations==  In 1936, Lewis and John C.

The stage version premiered on October 27, 1936 in 21 U.S. theatres in 17 states{{sfn|Flanagan|1940|p=}} simultaneously, in productions sponsored by the [[Federal Theater Project]]. A film version was in preparation at this time at [[MGM]], but studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]] soon canceled the production to the publicly announced pleasure of the Nazi regime in Germany. [[Will H.

Inspired by the book, director–producer [[Kenneth Johnson (producer)|Kenneth Johnson]] wrote an adaptation titled ''Storm Warnings'' in 1982. The script was presented to [[NBC]] for production as a television [[miniseries]], but NBC executives rejected the initial version, claiming it was too cerebral for the average American viewer. To make the script more marketable, the American fascists were re-cast as man-eating [[extraterrestrials]], taking the story into the realm of [[science fiction]]. The revised story became the miniseries [[V (1983 miniseries)|''V'']], which premiered May 3, 1983.{{sfn|Simpson}}  In the TV series [[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]] Season 1, episode 5 “Judgement”.

It also assumes that the spatial component of the metric can be time-dependent. The generic metric which meets these conditions is :<math>- c^2 \\mathrm{d}\\tau^2 = - c^2 \\mathrm{d}t^2 + {a(t)}^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2</math> where <math>\\mathbf{\\Sigma}</math> ranges over a 3-dimensional space of uniform curvature, that is, [[elliptical space]], [[Euclidean space]], or [[hyperbolic space]]. It is normally written as a function of three spatial coordinates, but there are several conventions for doing so, detailed below. <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}</math> does not depend on ''t'' — all of the time dependence is in the function ''a''(''t''), known as the \"[[Scale factor (universe)|scale factor]]\".  ===Reduced-circumference polar coordinates=== In reduced-circumference polar coordinates the spatial metric has the form :<math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}r^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Omega}^2, \\quad \\text{where } \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Omega}^2 = \\mathrm{d}\\theta^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi^2.</math>  ''k'' is a constant representing the curvature of the space. There are two common unit conventions: *''k'' may be taken to have units of length<sup>−2</sup>, in which case ''r'' has units of length and ''a''(''t'') is unitless. ''k'' is then the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the space at the time when ''a''(''t'') = 1. ''r'' is sometimes called the reduced [[circumference]] because it is equal to the measured circumference of a circle (at that value of ''r''), centered at the origin, divided by 2{{pi}} (like the ''r'' of [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]). Where appropriate, ''a''(''t'') is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}</math> measures [[comoving distance]]. *Alternatively, ''k'' may be taken to belong to the set {−1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then ''r'' is unitless and ''a''(''t'') has units of length. When ''k'' = ±1, ''a''(''t'') is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the space, and may also be written ''R''(''t'').  A disadvantage of reduced circumference coordinates is that they cover only half of the 3-sphere in the case of positive curvature—circumferences beyond that point begin to decrease, leading to degeneracy. (This is not a problem if space is [[elliptical geometry|elliptical]], i.e. a 3-sphere with opposite points identified.)  ===Hyperspherical coordinates=== In ''hyperspherical'' or ''curvature-normalized'' coordinates the coordinate ''r'' is proportional to radial distance; this gives :<math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2 = \\mathrm{d}r^2 + S_k(r)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Omega}^2</math> where <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Omega}</math> is as before and :<math>S_k(r) = \\begin{cases} \\sqrt{k}^{\\,-1} \\sin (r \\sqrt{k}), &k > 0 \\\\ r, &k = 0 \\\\ \\sqrt{|k|}^{\\,-1} \\sinh (r \\sqrt{|k|}), &k < 0. \\end{cases} </math>  As before, there are two common unit conventions: *''k'' may be taken to have units of length<sup>−2</sup>, in which case ''r'' has units of length and ''a''(''t'' ) is unitless.  ''k'' is then the [[Gaussian curvature]] of the space at the time when ''a''(''t'' ) = 1.  Where appropriate, ''a''(''t'' ) is often chosen to equal 1 in the present cosmological era, so that <math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}</math> measures [[comoving distance]]. *Alternatively, as before, ''k'' may be taken to belong to the set {−1,0,+1} (for negative, zero, and positive curvature respectively). Then ''r'' is unitless and ''a''(''t'' ) has units of length. When ''k'' = ±1, ''a''(''t'' ) is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of the space, and may also be written ''R''(''t'' ).  Note that, when ''k'' = +1, ''r'' is essentially a third angle along with ''θ'' and ''φ''. The letter ''χ''  may be used instead of&nbsp;''r''.  Though it is usually defined piecewise as above, ''S'' is an [[analytic function]] of both ''k'' and ''r''. It can also be written as a [[power series]] :<math>S_k(r) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^n k^n r^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!} = r - \\frac{k r^3}{6} + \\frac{k^2 r^5}{120} - \\cdots</math> or as :<math>S_k(r) = r \\; \\mathrm{sinc} \\, (r \\sqrt{k})</math> where sinc is the unnormalized [[sinc function]] and <math>\\sqrt{k}</math> is one of the imaginary, zero or real square roots of ''k''. These definitions are valid for all ''k''.  ===Cartesian coordinates=== When ''k'' = 0 one may write simply :<math>\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{\\Sigma}^2 = \\mathrm{d}x^2 + \\mathrm{d}y^2 + \\mathrm{d}z^2.</math> This can be extended to ''k'' ≠ 0 by defining :<math> x = r \\cos \\theta \\,</math>, :<math> y = r \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi \\,</math>, and :<math> z = r \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi \\,</math>, where ''r'' is one of the radial coordinates defined above, but this is rare.  == Solutions == {{General relativity sidebar |solutions}} {{main|Friedmann equations}}  Einstein's field equations are not used in deriving the general form for the metric: it follows from the geometric properties of homogeneity and isotropy. However, determining the time evolution of <math>a(t)</math> does require Einstein's field equations together with a way of calculating the density, <math>\\rho (t),</math> such as a [[equation of state (cosmology)|cosmological equation of state]].  This metric has an analytic solution to [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]] <math>G_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\\mu\\nu}</math> giving the [[Friedmann equations]] when the [[energy-momentum tensor]] is similarly assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous. The resulting equations are:<ref>{{citation |author=P. Ojeda and H.

Because the FLRW model assumes homogeneity, some popular accounts mistakenly assert that the big bang model cannot account for the observed lumpiness of the universe. In a strictly FLRW model, there are no clusters of galaxies, stars or people, since these are objects much denser than a typical part of the universe. Nonetheless, the FLRW model is used as a first approximation for the evolution of the real, lumpy universe because it is simple to calculate, and models which calculate the lumpiness in the universe are added onto the FLRW models as extensions. Most cosmologists agree that the [[observable universe]] is well approximated by an ''almost FLRW model'', i.e., a model which follows the FLRW metric apart from [[primordial fluctuations|primordial density fluctuations]]. {{As of|2003}}, the theoretical implications of the various extensions to the FLRW model appear to be well understood, and the goal is to make these consistent with observations from [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] and [[WMAP]].  ===Interpretation=== The pair of equations given above is equivalent to the following pair of equations :<math>{\\dot \\rho} = - 3 \\frac{\\dot a}{a}\\left(\\rho+\\frac{p}{c^{2}}\\right)</math> :<math>\\frac{\\ddot a}{a} = - \\frac{4\\pi G}{3}\\left(\\rho + \\frac{3p}{c^{2}}\\right) + \\frac{\\Lambda c^{2}}{3}</math> with <math>k</math>, the spatial curvature index, serving as a [[constant of integration]] for the first equation.  The first equation can be derived also from [[Thermodynamics of the universe|thermodynamical considerations]] and is equivalent to the [[first law of thermodynamics]], assuming the expansion of the universe is an [[adiabatic process]] (which is implicitly assumed in the derivation of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric).  The second equation states that both the energy density and the pressure cause the expansion rate of the universe <math>{\\dot a}</math> to decrease, i.e., both cause a deceleration in the expansion of the universe. This is a consequence of [[gravitation]], with pressure playing a similar role to that of energy (or mass) density, according to the principles of [[general relativity]]. The [[cosmological constant]], on the other hand, [[Dark energy|causes an acceleration in the expansion]] of the universe.  ===Cosmological constant=== The [[cosmological constant]] term can be omitted if we make the following replacements :<math>\\rho \\rightarrow \\rho + \\frac{\\Lambda c^{2}}{8 \\pi G}</math> :<math>p \\rightarrow p - \\frac{\\Lambda c^{4}}{8 \\pi G}.</math>  Therefore the [[cosmological constant]] can be interpreted as arising from a form of energy which has negative pressure, equal in magnitude to its (positive) energy density: :<math>p = - \\rho c^2. \\,</math> Such form of energy—a generalization of the notion of a [[cosmological constant]]—is known as [[dark energy]].  In fact, in order to get a term which causes an acceleration of the universe expansion, it is enough to have a [[scalar field theory|scalar field]] which satisfies :<math>p < - \\frac {\\rho c^2} {3}. \\,</math> Such a field is sometimes called [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]].  ===Newtonian interpretation=== The Friedmann equations are equivalent to this pair of equations: :<math> - a^3 {\\dot \\rho} = 3 a^2 {\\dot a} \\rho + \\frac{3 a^2 p {\\dot a}}{c^2} \\,</math> :<math>\\frac{{\\dot a}^2}{2} - \\frac{G \\frac{4 \\pi a^3}{3} \\rho}{a} = - \\frac{k c^2}{2} \\,.</math>  The first equation says that the decrease in the mass contained in a fixed cube (whose side is momentarily ''a'') is the amount which leaves through the sides due to the expansion of the universe plus the mass equivalent of the work done by pressure against the material being expelled. This is the conservation of mass-energy ([[first law of thermodynamics]]) contained within a part of the universe.  The second equation says that the kinetic energy (seen from the origin) of a particle of unit mass moving with the expansion plus its (negative) gravitational potential energy (relative to the mass contained in the sphere of matter closer to the origin) is equal to a constant related to the curvature of the universe. In other words, the energy (relative to the origin) of a co-moving particle in free-fall is conserved. General relativity merely adds a connection between the spatial curvature of the universe and the energy of such a particle: positive total energy implies negative curvature and negative total energy implies positive curvature.  The [[cosmological constant]] term is assumed to be treated as dark energy and thus merged into the density and pressure terms.  During the [[Planck epoch]], one cannot neglect [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects. So they may cause a deviation from the Friedmann equations.  == Name and history ==  The main results of the FLRW model were first derived by the Soviet mathematician [[Alexander Friedmann]] in 1922 and 1924. Although his work was published in the prestigious physics journal [[Zeitschrift für Physik]], it remained relatively unnoticed by his contemporaries. Friedmann was in direct communication with [[Albert Einstein]], who, on behalf of Zeitschrift für Physik, acted as the scientific referee of Friedmann's work. Eventually Einstein acknowledged the correctness of Friedmann's calculations, but failed to appreciate the physical significance of Friedmann's predictions.  Friedmann died in 1925. In 1927, [[Georges Lemaître]], a Belgian priest, astronomer and periodic professor of physics at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], arrived independently at similar results as Friedmann had and published them in Annals of the Scientific Society of Brussels. In the face of the observational evidence for the expansion of the universe obtained by [[Edwin Hubble]] in the late 1920s, Lemaître's results were noticed in particular by [[Arthur Eddington]], and in 1930–31 his paper was translated into English and published in the [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]].  [[Howard P. Robertson]] from the US and [[Arthur Geoffrey Walker]] from the UK explored the problem further during the 1930s. In 1935 Robertson and Walker rigorously proved that the FLRW metric is the only one on a spacetime that is spatially homogeneous and isotropic (as noted above, this is a geometric result and is not tied specifically to the equations of general relativity, which were always assumed by Friedmann and Lemaître).  Because the dynamics of the FLRW model were derived by Friedmann and Lemaître, the latter two names are often omitted by scientists outside the US. Conversely, US physicists often refer to it as simply \"Robertson–Walker\". The full four-name title is the most democratic and it is frequently used.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Often the \"Robertson–Walker\" ''metric'', so-called since they proved its generic properties, is distinguished from the dynamical \"Friedmann-Lemaître\" ''models'', specific solutions for ''a''(''t'') which assume that the only contributions to stress-energy are cold matter (\"dust\"), radiation, and a cosmological constant.  == Einstein's radius of the universe ==  '''Einstein's radius of the Universe''' is the [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of space of [[Einstein's universe]], a long-abandoned [[Static spacetime|static]] model that was supposed to represent our universe in idealized form. Putting :<math>\\dot{a} = \\ddot{a} = 0</math>  in the Friedmann equation, the radius of curvature of space of this universe (Einstein's radius) is{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} :<math>R_E=c/\\sqrt {4\\pi G\\rho}</math>,  where <math>c</math> is the speed of light, <math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant|Newtonian gravitational constant]], and <math>\\rho</math> is the density of space of this universe. The numerical value of Einstein's radius is of the order of 10<sup>10</sup> [[light year]]s.  == Evidence ==  By combining the observation data from some experiments such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] with theoretical results of [[Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem]] and its generalization,<ref>See pp. 351ff. in {{citation |last1=Hawking |first1=Stephen W. |last2=Ellis |first2=George F.

The Earls were periodically subject to the kings of [[Norway]] for the [[Northern Isles]], and later also to the kings of [[Kingdom of Alba|Alba]] for those parts of their territory in mainland Scotland (i.e. Caithness and Sutherland). The Earl's status as a Norwegian [[vassal]] was formalised in 1195. In 1232, a Scottish dynasty descended from the [[Mormaers of Angus]] replaced the previous family descended from the [[Mormaer of Atholl|Mormaers of Atholl]], although it remained formally subject to Norway. This family was in turn replaced by the descendants of the [[Mormaer of Strathearn|Mormaers of Strathearn]] and later still by the [[Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Sinclair family]], during whose time Orkney passed to Scots control.  ==Norse Earls== [[Rognvald Eysteinsson]], [[Earl of Møre]] ''fl.'' 865–890{{#tag:ref|Assuming an identification of Rognvald with \"Ragnall son of Albdann\" in 865.<ref>Radnor (tr.)

* Gille Brigte, son of Gille Brigte, perhaps the same as the previous Gille Brigte, ?–1256 * [[Magnus(II), son of Gille Brigte|Magnus, son of Gille Brigte]], 1256–1273 * [[Magnus Magnusson, Earl of Orkney|Magnus Magnusson]], 1273–1284 * [[Jón Magnússon, Earl of Orkney|Jón Magnússon]], 1284–c. 1300 * [[Magnús Jónsson, Earl of Orkney|Magnús Jónsson]], c. 1300–1321  ===Strathearn and Sinclair Earls=== Some time after Magnus Jonsson's death, around 1331, the Earldom was granted to [[Maol Íosa V, Earl of Strathearn|Maol Íosa]] (Malise), [[Mormaer of Strathearn]], a distant relative of the first Earl Gille Brigte. Maol Íosa ruled Orkney and Caithness from 1331 to 1350. He left several daughters, but no sons. Orkney passed to his son-in-law, the Swedish councillor [[Erengisle Suneson, Earl of Orkney|Erengisle Suneson]]. Another son-in-law, Alexander de l'Ard, ruled as [[Earl of Caithness]] from 1350 until 1375, when the Earldom passed to the [[King of the Scots]].  In 1379, the Earldom of Orkney, without Caithness, was granted to another son-in-law of Maol Íosa, [[Henry Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Henry Sinclair]], by King [[Haakon VI of Norway|Haakon VI Magnusson]]. Earl Henry ruled until his death in 1401, and was succeeded by a son named Henry, who was followed by his son [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness|Earl William]], to whom the Earldom of Caithness was granted by the King of Scots in 1455. However, Orkney and Shetland were pledged to [[James III of Scotland|James III]] in place of a dowry for his bride [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]] by [[Christian I]]. James took the Earldom of Orkney for the Crown in 1470, and William was thereafter Earl of Caithness alone until he resigned the Earldom in favour of his son William in 1476, dying in 1484.  * [[Maol Íosa V, Earl of Strathearn|Maol Íosa]], (Strathearn 1330–1334; Caithness 1331–1334) 1331–1350 * [[Erengisle Suneson, Earl of Orkney|Erengisle Suneson]], (Orkney only) 1353–1357 * [[Earl of Caithness|Alexander de l'Ard]], (Caithness only) 1350–1375 * [[Henry Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Henry Sinclair]], (Orkney and Shetland) 1379–1401 * [[Henry II Sinclair, Earl of Orkney|Henry Sinclair]], (Orkney and Shetland) 1401–? * [[William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness|William Sinclair]], (Orkney and Shetland 1434-1470; Caithness 1455–1476)  ==Scottish Earls== The next Orkney title was the [[Duke of Orkney|dukedom of Orkney]], which was given to [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], husband of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], in 1567. Later that year, however, he forfeited the title when his wife was forced to abdicate.  The second creation of the title was for [[Lord Robert Stewart]], an illegitimate son of [[James V of Scotland|King James V]]. His successor Patrick, however, forfeited the title.  The last creation of the earldom was in favour of the man who would become the first [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Field Marshal]], Lord [[George Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|George Hamilton]], the fifth son of [[William Douglas, Duke of Hamilton]]. By marriage, the title passed to the O'Brien family, then to the Fitzmaurice family, and finally to the St John family. The present earl holds the subsidiary titles of ''[[Viscount of Kirkwall]]'' and ''[[Lord Dechmont]]''. Both subsidiary titles were created at the same time as the earldom, in 1696.  ===Dukes of Orkney (1567)=== * [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|James Hepburn, 1st Duke of Orkney]] (c. 1535–1578) (forfeit 1567)  ===Earls of Orkney, Second Creation (1581)=== * [[Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney]] (1533–1593) * [[Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney]] (c. 1569–1614) (forfeit 1614)  ===Earls of Orkney, Third Creation (1696)=== [[File:1stEarlOfOrkney.jpg|thumb|George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney (third creation)]] The third creation came in 1696 when the soldier [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|Lord George Hamilton]] was made '''Lord Dechmont''', '''Viscount of Kirkwall''' and '''Earl of Orkney''' in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. Hamilton was the fifth son of [[William Douglas-Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton|William Douglas-Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton and 1st Earl of Selkirk]] and his wife [[Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton]]. The peerages were created with remainder to the heirs whatsoever of his body, which means that the titles can be passed on through both male and female lines. Lord Orkney was succeeded by his eldest daughter Anne, the second Countess. She married her first cousin [[William O'Brien, 4th Earl of Inchiquin]]. On her death the titles passed to her daughter, the third Countess. She married her second cousin [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Marquess of Thomond]] (the nephew of the fourth [[Earl of Inchiquin]]). She was succeeded by her daughter, the fourth Countess. She married the Hon. Thomas Fitzmaurice, second son of [[John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne]] and younger brother of Prime Minister [[William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne]]. On her death the titles passed to her grandson, [[John FitzMaurice, Viscount Kirkwall|Viscount Kirkwall]]'s son, the fifth Earl. He sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Representative peer|Scottish Representative Peer]] from 1833 to 1874.   His son, the sixth Earl, was a [[Representative peer|Scottish Representative Peer]] from 1885 to 1889. He was succeeded by his nephew, the seventh Earl. On his death the peerages passed to his first cousin twice removed, the eighth Earl. He was the great-grandson of the Hon. Frederick Fitzmaurice, third son of the fifth Earl. The succession was approved by the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] in 1955. He died childless and was succeeded by his third cousin, the ninth Earl. He is the son of Frederick Oliver St John, son of Isabella Annie Fitzmaurice, daughter of the Hon. James Terence Fitzmaurice, fifth son of the fifth Earl of Orkney. Lord Orkney lives in Canada and has been a professor at the [[University of Manitoba]]. His paternal grandfather [[Frederick Robert St John|Sir Frederick Robert St John]] was the youngest son of the Hon. Ferdinand St John, third son of [[George St John, 3rd Viscount Bolingbroke|George St John, 3rd Viscount Bolingbroke and 4th Viscount St John]]. Consequently, Lord Orkney is also in remainder to the viscounties of Bolingbroke and St John and their subsidiary titles.  * [[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney]] (1666–1737) * [[Anne O'Brien, 2nd Countess of Orkney]] (d. 1756) * [[Mary O'Brien, 3rd Countess of Orkney]] (c. 1721–1791) * [[Mary FitzMaurice, 4th Countess of Orkney]] (1755–1831) * [[Thomas FitzMaurice, 5th Earl of Orkney|Thomas John Hamilton FitzMaurice, 5th Earl of Orkney]] (1803–1877) * [[George FitzMaurice, 6th Earl of Orkney|George William Hamilton FitzMaurice, 6th Earl of Orkney]] (1827–1889) * [[Edmond Walter FitzMaurice, 7th Earl of Orkney]] (1867–1951) * [[Cecil FitzMaurice, 8th Earl of Orkney|Cecil O'Bryen FitzMaurice, 8th Earl of Orkney]] (1919–1998) * [[Oliver Peter St John, 9th Earl of Orkney]] (b. 1938)  The [[heir apparent]] is the present holder's son Oliver Robert St John, Viscount Kirkwall (b. 1969).  {{hidden|Family tree|{{familytree/start}} {{familytree|GH| | | | | | | | | |GH='''[[George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney|George Hamilton,<br>1st Earl of Orkney]]'''<br>1666–1737}} {{familytree |!|}} {{familytree|AOB| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AOB='''[[Anne O'Brien, 2nd Countess of Orkney|Anne O'Brien,<br>2nd Countess of Orkney]]'''<br>d. 1756}} {{familytree |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}} {{familytree|MOB| | | | | | | | | |MOB='''[[Mary O'Brien, 3rd Countess of Orkney|Mary O'Brien,<br>3rd Countess of Orkney]]'''<br>1835}} {{familytree |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}} {{familytree|MM| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |MM='''[[Mary FitzMaurice, 4th Countess of Orkney|Mary FitzMaurice,<br>4th Countess of Orkney]]'''<br>1778–1820}} {{familytree |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}} {{familytree|MM| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |MM=[[John FitzMaurice, Viscount Kirkwall|John FitzMaurice,<br>Viscount Kirkwall]]<br>1755–1831}} {{familytree |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}} {{familytree|TF| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |TF='''[[Thomas FitzMaurice, 5th Earl of Orkney|Thomas FitzMaurice,<br>5th Earl of Orkney]]'''<br>1803–1877}} {{familytree |)|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}} {{familytree|GF| |HWF| |FOF| |JF| | | | | | | | |GF='''[[George FitzMaurice, 6th Earl of Orkney|George FitzMaurice,<br>6th Earl of Orkney]]'''<br>1827–1889|HWF=Hon.

The Act made it illegal to \"use [a house] or allow any person to make use of it to propagate [[Communism]] or [[Bolshevism]] by any means whatsoever\" as well as the printing, publishing or distributing of \"any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing, propagating Communism or Bolshevism.\" A violation of the Act subjected such property to being ordered closed by the Attorney General - \"padlocked\" - against any use whatsoever for a period of up to one year, and any person found guilty of involvement in prohibited media activities could be incarcerated for three to thirteen months.  [[File:News. Communistic Literature BAnQ P48S1P02676.jpg|thumb|left|Men reading confiscated literature in [[Montreal City Hall]], 1938]] The law was extremely vague; it did not define Communism or Bolshevism in any concrete way.  It denied both the [[presumption of innocence]] and [[freedom of speech]] to individuals. There were also concerns that the law would be used in order to arrest individual activists from international [[trade union]]s. Two union leaders were nearly arrested in that period.<ref>Rouillard, Jacques (1989). ''Le syndicalisme québécois : Deux siècles d'histoire.'' Montréal: Éditions Boréal, at page 68. ISBN 2-89052-243-1</ref> While it was applied frequently against a range of radical leftist groups, allegations that Duplessis used it against political opponents, including the left-wing [[United Jewish Peoples' Order]] in 1950, reports that it was used against the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] are incorrect: the authorities typically used municipal by-laws, such as the one featured in [[Saumur v. The City of Quebec]].  The federal government under [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] could have used its power of [[disallowance and reservation|disallowance]] to nullify the Padlock Law, as it had done to overturn equally controversial laws that had been passed by [[Alberta]]'s [[Alberta Social Credit Party|Social Credit government]] around the same time.  However, King chose not to intervene in Quebec.  The most likely reason is that King did not want to alienate rural voters in Quebec, who continued to support the Liberals federally even as they supported the Union Nationale provincially.  In the 1957 decision of ''[[Switzman v. Elbling]]'', the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] struck down the law as unconstitutional because it not only violated the constitutional right to free speech, but because provincial governments did not have the power to legislate in the field of criminal law.  == References ==  <references/>  == External links == *[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/LoiduCadenas-PadlockLaw-MauriceDuplessis-QuebecHistory.htm Documents on the Padlock Law from Marianopolis College] *[http://www.historyofrights.com/events/padlock.html Canadian Rights Movement for the Padlock Act]  [[Category:Political history of Quebec]] [[Category:Quebec provincial legislation]] [[Category:Anti-communism]] [[Category:1937 establishments in Quebec]] [[Category:History of human rights in Canada]] [[Category:1937 in Canadian law]] [[Category:1957 disestablishments in Canada]] [[Category:Media legislation]] [[Category:Repealed Canadian legislation]] [[Category:Illegal speech]] [[Category:Real property law]] [[Category:Trade union legislation]] [[Category:Political law]]</td></tr><tr><td>1894 in architecture</td><td>595343</td><td>671225507</td><td>2015-07-13T08:46:00.000+0000</td><td>Fayenatic london</td><td>1639942</td><td>{{Year nav topic5|1894|architecture}}  The year '''1894 in architecture''' involved some significant events.  ==Events== * In the [[United States]], the [[Society of Beaux-Arts Architects]] is founded.  ==Buildings opened== [[File:Prudential Building HDR.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Louis Sullivan]]'s [[Prudential (Guaranty) Building|Guaranty Building]]]] *[[April 21]] - [[Quatro de Setembro Theater]], [[Teresina]], Brazil, opened. *[[May 14]] - [[Blackpool Tower]] in [[Blackpool]], [[England]], is completed to a design by [[Maxwell and Tuke]] and opened to the public. *[[June 30]] - [[Tower Bridge]] in [[London]], designed by [[Horace Jones (architect)]] and [[John Wolfe-Barry]], opened. *July - [[Dalen Hotel]] in [[Norway]], designed by [[Haldor Børve]].<ref>[http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Norway/Telemark/Dalen-221702/TravelGuide-Dalen.html Virtual Tourist: Dalen Travel Guide].

Hullshire may refer to the area outside the town of [[Kingston upon Hull]] within the county, whilst the entire entity was sometimes referred to as the \"Town and County of Hull\".  ==History== Hull was made a county town in 1440 in the reign of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]. A  number of small towns nearby were separated from [[Yorkshire]] and added to it.{{sfn|Tickell|1798|pp=661–2}}{{sfn|Gent|1869|loc=Chap.VII pp.99–100 (p)}} The region was self-governing (a [[County corporate]]) in respect of it having its own courts, with powers of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'', to hold [[assizes]] on civil and criminal cases.{{sfn|Tickell|1798|p=685}} At creation the county had included into it the town and parishes of [[Hessle]] (Hassel), [[North Ferriby]], [[Swanland]], [[West Ella|West-Ella]], [[Kirk Ella|Kirk-Ella]], [[Tranby]]. Willardby ([[Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire|Willerby]]), [[Anlaby]] and the [[Haltemprice Priory|priory of Haltemprise]].{{sfn|Tickell|1798|p=93-95}} The rights previously given to the town of Hull were extended to the county, with the Mayor acting as the King's [[Escheat|Escheator]], and with the town [[Bailiff]]s replaced by [[Sheriff]] and twelve [[Aldermen]], acting as [[Justices of the Peace]] within the county, with the [[Burgess (title)|Burgess]]es to answer before the Mayor and Sheriff first, not the King. The Justices of the Peace of the East Riding had no legal authority in the county.{{sfn|Tickell|1798|pp=92–3, 96–8}} At the same time [[Hull Castle]] became the responsibility of the town.{{sfn|Gent|1869|loc=Chap.VII p.118 (ccc)}}  In 1515 a skirmish or battle was fought between the Sheriff of Hull and the Prior of [[Haltemprice Priory]] over the authority over [[Willerby, East Riding of Yorkshire|Willerby]] (Willarby) and [[Wolfreton]] (Woolfreton) – the Prior claimed that though the priory was within the Shire of Hull it was not part of it, and was within the Lordship of [[Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire|Cottingham]], and had taken the issue to the [[Star Chamber]]; the case was referred to the Abbott of [[Meaux, East Riding of Yorkshire|Meaux]]; Bryan Palmes; and Sir [[William Constable]] who had decided in the Prior's favour. Despite this decision on 6 October the Sheriff of Hull together with 200 people of the town began to approach Wolfreton; the Prior, who had been informed of the Sheriff's intentions roused his tenants, and armed the monks of the Priory, who then blocked the roads, and hurled abuse on the Sheriff and his people. The Sheriff's party returned the insults in turn using foul language. Subsequently the altercation came to blows and a quarrel with arrows ensued. The battle continued until the monks, many being old or fat, gave way, and fled to their priory, followed by the Sheriff's group. The situation was prevented from becoming more inflamed by the arrival of the Lord Mayor of Hull, who having learned of what was happening hastened to the scene with 60 horsemen. Subsequently the Prior sort redress in the Star Chamber, with the Sheriff accuseed of riot and other crimes – the legal proceedings continued for three years at much expense, leading to the settlement that the Prior was given Willerby and Newton within his authority, whilst Hull obtained free right to the fresh water springs of Anlaby.{{sfn|Tickell|1798|pp=141–3}}  [[Sculcoates]], [[Drypool]], the southern part of Sutton ([[Sutton-on-Hull]]), [[Garrison Side]] as well as the liberties of [[Myton, Hull|Myton]] and [[Trippett]] were added to the parliamentary borough in 1832, and in 1836 the new municipal borough was made to be of the same extent. (see also [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]). Newington (parishes of Kirk Ella and North Ferriby); [[Stoneferry]]; [[Marfleet]] and [[Newland, Kingston upon Hull|Newland]] were added in the second half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"bound1\">{{citation| url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66770#s3| title = The City of Kingston upon Hull : Boundaries| volume=1.

Initially, Morrigan was to be the \"cute\" female character of the title, while Felicia would be the \"sexy\" female character. However, as Morrigan's character developed into that of a [[succubus]] she was made to be far more sexually appealing, and the roles of the two characters were reversed.  Felicia is a cute-faced, curvaceous \"[[bakeneko]]\". As such, she has cat ears, pointed teeth, a tail, and oversized hands and feet that resemble a cat's paws, complete with sharp claws that she uses in battle. She also has a heavy mane of long blue hair, blue eyes, and an \"outfit\" that consists entirely of thin strips of skimpy white fur. The fur leaves her technically nude except for that which partially covers her breasts, portions of her stomach and hips, and forms panty-like bottoms, as well as covering her arms and legs. [[Felicia|Her name]] is adapted from [[Latin language|Latin]] [[Felicity (given name)|Felicity]] (\"happy\" or \"happiness\").  [[Gameplay]]-wise, Felicia is similar to ''[[Street Fighter]]'''s [[Chun-Li]] but with some major differences. She uses quick nimble attacks and has particularly long [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]].<ref>''Official Sega Saturn Magazine'' 9, page 84.</ref> {{clear left}}  ==Appearances== ===In video games=== Felicia is a catwoman who was taken in and raised by a [[Catholic]] nun named Rose. When Rose died, Felicia left her town hoping to become a music star. She knew that the outside world was not pretty as it was filled with much prejudice towards darkstalkers for being different. Despite this, Felicia never lost hope, as she remembered what she was told before that one has to obtain happiness on their own. She wishes there to be a way for peaceful coexistence between darkstalkers and humans alike. For that, she pursues her dream of becoming a star to serve as a bridge between them. During her travels, she met many other catgirls of her kind. With her new found catgirl friends (Alto, Grace, Lucy, Nana & Mimi, Nonno, and Piko), she set out for her dream of being on stage.  Besides the ''Darkstalkers'' series, Felicia appears as a [[player character|playable character]] in several other video games, including ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]'',  ''[[Cross Edge]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'', ''[[Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix|Pocket Fighter]]'', ''[[Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo|Puzzle Fighter]]'', ''[[Project X Zone 2]]'', ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium]]'', ''[[SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash]]'', ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3]]'' and ''[[Onimusha]] Soul'' (redesign to fit it [[feudal Japan]] theme<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.oni-soul.jp/contents/collabo/index_m.html#collabo|title=鬼武者Soul CAPCOMタイトルコラボ|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>). In the crossover tactical role-playing game ''[[Namco × Capcom]]'', Felicia teams up with [[King (Tekken)|King II]] from ''[[Tekken]]'' to make the only two-character team in the game to include both a [[Namco]] character and a Capcom character. She is set to appear in ''[[Project X Zone 2]]'' as an ally support unit. <ref>http://www.destructoid.com/meow-felicia-confirmed-for-project-x-zone-2-294402.phtml</ref>  ===Other appearances=== The anime OAV ''[[Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge (anime)|Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge]]'' (1997), Felicia is shown as already having a certain amount of success as an entertainer and is just starting a tour in the human world with her own traveling show. However, her tour gets off to a rough start when she is almost killed by monks pertaining to an anti-darkstalker militia and the zombie [[Lord Raptor]] saves her by promptly killing them all. Later, as [[Pyron]] begins his bid for world domination, Felicia attacks his Huitzil robot army. She destroys a few of the robots before being overwhelmed, but she is saved when the werewolf [[Jon Talbain]] intervenes. She is taken in by a human doctor and befriends the local children, only to be captured by a human paramilitary group. The doctor rescues her and with her faith in humanity renewed she, along with Talbain, lures the robots out of the town and destroying them with an explosives laden train. A major difference between this Felicia and the game's Felicia is that there is no mention of her origin and her religiosity is reversed: while it can be assumed from her being raised by a nun that the game Felicia is Catholic, her anime counterpart informs Raptor she is ambivalent to organized religion.  Felicia is the main hero in the American cartoon series ''[[Darkstalkers (TV series)|Darkstalkers]]'' (1995), in which she was accompanied by Harry Grimoire, a character created for this particular series whose purpose (aside from a plot device) was mainly to get Felicia into trouble. She is also stated to be several hundred years old in this. Her dreams of being a singer are never mentioned (although in the first episode she was fired from ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' because her \"costume\" was \"out of date\"). Felicia was also depicted as possibly being the last of her kind, despite having other catgirl friends in the game series itself.  In the [[UDON|UDON Comics]] version of ''Darkstalkers'', Felicia is still looking for her big break into stardom; unfortunately being a catgirl proves to be a very large roadblock on the path to fame. Along the way, she runs into Talbain who believes that humans are treacherous and vile, while she thinks that the current hatred between humans and darkstalkers are just a few \"bumps in the road.\" Despite the fact that his interference costs her a potential gig, Felicia asks Talbain to accompany her, so that she can try to prove to him that humanity is not all bad. Eventually, they end up at the Catholic orphanage where Felicia grew up; her foster mother is named Sister Cecillia and is still alive and active in her foster daughter's life.  Several figurines of Felicia have been made since her introduction, ranging from immobile figurines by companies such as [[Kaiyodo]], [[Volks]], Yujin, Clayz, Kotobukiya, and MIT Japan, to a posable action figure by Medicom Toy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Darkstalkers Graphic File |last=Udon Staff |year=2008 |publisher=Udon Entertainment |isbn=1-897376-04-9 |pages=136–137}}</ref> She is also a character card in the collectible card game ''[[Universal Fighting System]]''. In the [[shōnen]] manga series ''[[Love Hina]]'', a few of the main female characters appear in the costumes of B.B. Hood, Hsien-Ko, and Felicia—though much less revealing—for Halloween in chapter 86 of the manga. In the [[Cartoon Network]] animated series ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'' (2011), Felicia makes cameo in the season one segment \"Gaming's Next Top Princess\". {{-}}  ==Reception and cultural impact== [[File:Darkstalkers FanimeCon 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cosplay]]ers of Felicia and [[Q-Bee]] at [[FanimeCon]] 2014.

There are about 30 species included in the genus. They are found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.   ==Description== The young specimens are columnar but as they grow older ribs form and they take on a barrel form. Most of the species are solitary but some, such as ''[[Ferocactus robustus]]'' and ''[[Ferocactus glaucescens|F. glaucescens]]'', form clumps. The flowers are pink, yellow, red or purple depending on the species, and the petals sometimes have a stripe of a darker colour.  ==Habitat== They are [[desert]] dwellers and can cope with some frost and intense heat. The typical habitat is hot and very arid, and the plants have adapted to exploit water movement to concentrate their biomass in areas where water is likely to be present. Like ''[[Sclerocactus]]'', ''Ferocactus'' typically grow in areas where water flows irregularly or depressions where water can accumulate for short periods of time. They are most often found growing along [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] (washes) where their seeds have been subjected to [[Scarification (botany)|scarfication]] due to water movement, but they oddly also tend to grow along ridges in spots where depressions have formed and can hold water for some period of time.  ==Adaptations== ''Ferocactus'' have very shallow root systems and are easily uprooted during flash floods. The \"fishhook\" spines and the armored web of spines enclosing the cactus body in many species of this genus are adaptations which allow the plant to move to more favorable locations. The seeds germinate in areas where water movement occurs or in areas where standing water accumulates for some period of time, and during [[flash flood]]s, the hooked spines allow the plants to be caught on waterborne debris, uprooted and carried to areas where water tends to accumulate.  ==Cultivation== In cultivation ferocactus require full sun, little water, and good drainage. They are popular as [[houseplants]].  They cannot tolerate freezing temperatures for extended periods, which typically cause them to yellow, bleach, then slowly die. [[plant propagation|Propagation]] is usually from seeds.  ==Ecology== Many ferocactus species are [[ant plant]]s, exuding nectar along the upper meristem from extrafloral nectaries above each areole, and hosting ant colonies.  ==Selected species== [[File:Ferocactusrobustus.jpg|thumb|''Ferocactus robustus'', [[Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve]], Mexico]] [[File:Ferocactus wislizeni338980330.jpg|thumb|''Ferocactus wislizeni'' in bloom]] * ''[[Ferocactus alamosanus]]'' * ''[[Ferocactus chrysacanthus]]'' * ''[[Ferocactus cylindraceus]]'' <small>(Engelm.)

He also wrote the final episode of the [[Beast Wars]]: Transformers cartoon, the Transformers Ultimate Fan Guide, and several convention exclusive comics and novellas.  His first published work appeared in 1984 in Fleetway's weekly comic, ''[[Scream! (comics)|Scream!]]'' issue 3, writing the opening episode of \"Terror of the Cats\". He currently writes Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Transformers for Titan Magazines in the UK and the US Transformers comic line published by IDW.  He has also used the pseudonym '''Chris Francis''' on occasion, most notable when editing Marvel UK's ''Transformers'' to keep his role separate from writing some of the stories.  ==Career== Furman invented an origin story for the ''Transformers'' that involved an ancient struggle between the colossal godlike creator, [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]], and his counterpart, the colossal godlike destroyer, [[Unicron]]. The latter was borrowed from the ''Transformers'' movie, where he appeared with no given backstory (a conflicting origin for Unicron later came in the third season of the original Transformers cartoon series). According to Furman's origin story, The Transformers were a creation of Primus as a warrior race who were to be the last line of defence against Unicron. This origin differs from the third season of the cartoon series, where the Transformers were originally created to be robot servants of the alien [[Quintesson]]s, who often sold them to other races.  Aside from the creation myth, mythological underpinnings can be found in several of his stories such as the [[Matrix Quest]] storyline, where the [[Autobot]]s and [[Decepticon]]s search for the [[Creation Matrix]], a powerful object constructed by Primus.  Furman's ''Transformers: Generation 2'' plot-line in 1993 introduced the characters Jhiaxus and [[Liege Maximo]], one of the first Transformers. Liege Maximo had killed the first Prime to steal the Matrix and claimed that the Decepticons descended from him. Since Transformers Generation 2 was cancelled after 12 issues, the Liege Maximo storyline was concluded in the convention exclusive novella ''Alignment''.  Over ten years later, Furman was brought in by the now-defunct independent comics publisher [[Dreamwave]] to write some of its Transformers comics, including \"[[Transformers: The War Within|The War Within]]\", a six issue prequel set on Cybertron before the Autobots and Decepticons took their battle to Earth. It spawned two sequels – \"TWW: The Dark Ages\" and \"TWW: The Age Of Wrath\" (uncompleted). His work on the Armada and Energon titles were also received better than the anime series from which they were based on. Furman was to have continued on with Dreamwave, but its contentious closure resulted in the premature end of the Energon and The War Within titles.  Furman's convention exclusive novella/comic serial, ''The Omega Point'', includes an apocalyptic End of Days scenario for the Transformers, and a quest by one of the heroes to ask for help in the land of the dead.  Simon Furman still collaborates with regular Marvel UK Transformers artist, [[Andrew Wildman]], as WildFur Productions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildfur.net/ |title=wildfur productions |publisher=Wildfur.net |date= |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref> Their most recent collaboration was on the [[Macromedia Flash]] online, interactive comic ''The Engine: Industrial Strength'', which they produced with UK New Media expert [[Adam Jennings]].  Away from Transformers, Furman wrote a Doctor Who audio adventure for [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]. ''[[The Axis of Insanity]]'' features the Fifth Doctor, and was published in 2004. He also contributed a number of stories starring [[Judge Dredd]] to the [[DC Comics|DC]] title ''Judge Dredd: Lawman of the Future'', as well as one-off stories to Dredd's home title ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]''.  Furman is currently writing a new continuity of \"Generation 1\" Transformers comic books for [[IDW Publishing]].

The station is located on the DLR's [[Stratford station|Stratford branch]], between [[Devons Road DLR station|Devons Road]] and [[Pudding Mill Lane DLR station|Pudding Mill Lane]] stations and is in [[Travelcard Zone 2]]. It is within 300 m walking distance of [[Bow Road tube station|Bow Road station]] on [[London Underground]]'s [[District line|District]] and [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith and City]] lines. Through ticketing is allowed between both stations. The DLR station opened with the original system on 31 August 1987. The station takes its name from the nearby 14th century [[Bow Church]], which is an [[Church of England|Anglican]] church.  There is a crossover south of the station which allows trains from Stratford and Poplar to reverse here. One example of this is when the new platforms at Stratford were being constructed - trains were suspended between Bow Church and Stratford and trains from Poplar terminated here.  ==Connections== [[London Buses]] routes [[London Buses route 25|25]], [[London Buses route 205|205]], [[London Buses route 425|425]] and [[London Buses route D8|D8]], night route [[List of night buses in London#N205|N205]] and [[National Express Coaches]] route [[National Express Coaches#routes|A9]] serve the station.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== {{commons category}} * [http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gettingaround/transportaccessibility/dlr/3268.aspx Docklands Light Railway website - Bow Church station page]  {{s-rail-start}} {{s-rail|title=DLR}} {{s-line|system=DLR|line=DLR|previous=Devons Road|next=Pudding Mill Lane|type=Lewisham|type2=Stratford}} {{end}}  {{Docklands Light Railway}}  <!--Categories--> [[Category:Docklands Light Railway stations in Tower Hamlets]] [[Category:Railway stations opened in 1987]] [[Category:Bow, London]]   {{London-dlr-stub}} {{London-railstation-stub}}</td></tr><tr><td>The Globe Sessions</td><td>1128231</td><td>674099693</td><td>2015-08-01T17:01:58.000+0000</td><td>DavidRavenMoon</td><td>1296476</td><td>{{Infobox album <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Albums --> |Name=The Globe Sessions |Type=studio |Artist=[[Sheryl Crow]] |Cover=Sheryl_Crow,_The_Globe_Sessions.png |Released={{Start date|1998|9|21}} <small>([[United Kingdom|UK]])</small><br /> {{Start date|1998|9|29}} <small>([[United States|US]])</small> |Recorded=Globe Studios, [[New York City|New York, NY]] and [[Sound Factory|Sunset Sound Factory]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles, CA]], 1996-98 |Genre=[[Rock music|Rock]], [[blues rock]], [[country rock]] |Length=55:06 |Label=[[A&M Records|A&M]] |Producer=[[Sheryl Crow]] <br> [[Rick Rubin]] <small>(\"Sweet Child o' Mine\")</small> |Last album=''[[Sheryl Crow (album)|Sheryl Crow]]''<br />(1996) |This album='''''The Globe Sessions'''''<br />(1998) |Next album=''[[Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live from Central Park]]''<br />(1999) | Misc                = {{Singles   | Name            = The Globe Sessions   | Type              = studio   | single 1         = [[My Favorite Mistake]]   | single 1 date = September 15, 1998   | single 2         = [[There Goes the Neighborhood (Sheryl Crow song)|There Goes the Neighborhood]]   | single 2 date = 1999   | single 3         = [[Anything but Down]]   | single 3 date = February 23, 1999   }} }} {{Album ratings | rev1 = [[Allmusic]] | rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r373479|tab=review|label=\"Sheryl Crow: ''The Globe Sessions'' > Review\" |first=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> | rev2 = Daily Vault | rev2Score = (B)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=518 |title=''The Globe Sessions'': Sheryl Crow |first=Sean |last=McCarthy |date={{date|10/26/1998}} |publisher=DailyVault.com |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> | rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | rev3Score = A−<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285184,00.html |title=''The Globe Sessions'' (1998): Sheryl Crow, Joni Mitchell |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date={{date|Oct 09, 1998}} |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue=#453 |publisher=Time |issn=1049-0434 |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> | rev4 = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | rev4Score = {{rating|4|4}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/27/entertainment/ca-26892 |title=Sheryl Crow 'The Globe Sessions' |date= {{date|September 27, 1998}} |first=Elysa |last=Gardner |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=Tribune Company |issn=0458-3035 |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> | rev5 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' | rev5Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/301552/sherylcrow?pageid=rs.ArtistDiscography&pageregion=triple1 |title=''Sheryl Crow'': The Globe Sessions |first=James |last=Hunter |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=RS 797 |publisher=Straight Arrow |issn=0035-791X |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050326222828/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/301552/sherylcrow?pageid=rs.ArtistDiscography&pageregion=triple1 |archivedate={{date|2005-03-26}}}}</ref> | rev6 = [[Robert Christgau]] | rev6Score = {{Rating-Christgau|hm1}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=1242 |title=Sheryl Crow |first=Robert |last=Christgau |publisher=RobertChristgau.com |accessdate={{date|2011-05-11}}}}</ref> }}  '''''The Globe Sessions''''' is the third studio [[album]] by [[United States|American]] [[singer/songwriter]] [[Sheryl Crow]], released on 21 September 1998 in the [[United Kingdom]] and 29 September 1998 in the [[United States]], then re-released in 1999.

The basis for the Krylov subspace is derived from the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] which implies that the inverse of a matrix can be found in terms of a linear combination of its powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.uu.nl/people/vorst/kryl.html|title=A.N.Krylov, a short biography|author=Mike Botchev|year=2002}}6 Dec. 2012.</ref><ref>Grigorian, A.

Encyclopedia.com. 6 Dec. 2012.</ref>  ==Use== Modern [[iterative method]]s for finding one (or a few) eigenvalues of large [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]] or solving large systems of linear equations avoid matrix-matrix operations, but rather multiply vectors by the matrix and work with the resulting vectors. Starting with a vector, ''b'', one computes <math>A b</math>, then one multiplies that vector by <math>A</math> to find <math>A^2 b</math> and so on.  All algorithms that work this way are referred to as Krylov subspace methods; they are among the most successful methods currently available in numerical linear algebra.    ==Issues== Because the vectors usually soon become almost [[linear independence|linearly dependent]] due to the properties of [[power iteration]], methods relying on Krylov subspace frequently involve some [[orthogonalization]] scheme, such as [[Lanczos iteration]] for [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] or [[Arnoldi iteration]] for more general matrices.  ==Existing methods== The best known Krylov subspace methods are the [[Arnoldi iteration|Arnoldi]], [[Lanczos iteration|Lanczos]], [[Conjugate gradient]], [[IDR(s)]] (Induced dimension reduction), [[GMRES]] (generalized minimum residual), [[BiCGSTAB]] (biconjugate gradient stabilized), [[quasi minimal residual|QMR]] (quasi minimal residual), [[TFQMR]] (transpose-free QMR), and [[MINRES]] (minimal residual) methods.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==Bibliography== * '''Key reference paper''': A N Krylov.

It runs from the I-91/I-391 interchange in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]] to the center of [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]], a distance of about {{convert|4.86|mi|km|abbr=on}}. It runs near the [[Connecticut River]] throughout its journey in Chicopee, and crosses into Holyoke and abruptly ends at High Street {{convert|0.4|mi|km}} south of [[U.S. Route 202]].<ref name=eot/>  ==Route description== Interstate 391 begins at an interchange with [[Interstate 91|I-91]] (at Exit 12) in southern [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]], just north of the Atwater Park and the Calvary Cemetery. Initially running parallel to the [[Connecticut River]], it intersects with [[Massachusetts Route 116|Route 116]] in Chicopee center and crosses the [[Chicopee River]]. I-391 then has another junction with Route 116 in the Sandy Hill section of town, and in less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km), it crosses underneath the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] without an interchange. I-391 continues north through the rest of northern Chicopee, intersecting [[Massachusetts Route 141|Route 141]] along the way and then passing just east of Rivers Park. I-391 then crosses the Connecticut River into the city of [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]], where it has two closely spaced exits for local streets in the town.

By the 1960s, freeway access was needed between Chicopee and Holyoke to improve traffic flow which prompted a spur route of Interstate 91 to be built. I-391's planned six lanes were built to handle up to 50,000 vehicles every day, and the total cost of the proposed highway was estimated at about $35 million. In 1965, an alignment of the highway had been set, along with two alternative alignments. Construction for Interstate 391 began in 1967 with a short {{convert|0.75|mi|km|abbr=on}} long highway, which was completed in 1970. After years of no progress, construction started again in 1978. The highway was completed in 1982 after about 15 years of planning and construction.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bostonroads.com|title=Interstate 391 (Massachusetts)|year=|publisher=|accessdate=2008-05-26|url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-391_MA/}}</ref>  [[File:I-391 near MA-141.jpg|thumb|right|Just before the Route 141 interchange]]  ==Exit list== {{jcttop|exit|state=MA|county=Hampden|length_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\">{{cite web|url=http://services.massdot.state.ma.us/mrla/RouteSelection.htm|title=Massachusetts Route Log Application|author=MassDOT Planning Division|date=|website=|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref>|location_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\" />}} {{MAint|exit |location=Chicopee |lspan=5 |mile=0.065 |exit=1A |road={{jct|state=MA|I|91|dir1=south|city1=Springfield|location2=[[Hartford, CT]]}} |notes=}} {{MAint|exit |mile=0.626 |exit=1B |road={{jct|state=MA|I|91|dir1=north|city1=Greenfield}} |notes=}} {{MAint|exit |mile=0.952 |exit=2 |road={{jct|state=MA|MA|116|location1=Chicopee Center}} |notes=To [[Elms College]]}} {{MAint|exit |mile=1.900 |exit=3 |road={{jct|state=MA|MA|116|location1=[[Westover Air Reserve Base|Westover ARB]]|city2=Willimansett}} |notes=}} {{MAint|exit |mile=3.860 |exit=4 |type=concur |road={{jct|state=MA|MA|141|dir1=south|city1=Chicopee Falls|city2=Willimansett}} |notes=South end of overlap with Route 141; split into exits 4A (east) and 4B (west) southbound}} {{jctbridge|exit |location_special=[[Connecticut River]] |mile=4.509 |bridge=Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge}} {{MAint|exit |location=Holyoke |lspan=3 |mile=4.593 |exit=5 |type=concur |road={{jct|state=MA|MA|141|dir1=north|name1=Main Street}} |notes=North end of overlap with Route 141; northbound exit and southbound entrance}} {{MAint|exit |mile=4.940 |exit=6 |road=Commercial Street |notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance}} {{MAint|exit |mile=5.160 |exit=&ndash; |road=High Street |notes=At-grade intersection; northern terminus}} {{jctbtm|keys=incomplete,concur}}  ==References== {{Reflist}}  ==External links== {{AttachedKML|display=title,inline}} * [http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-391_MA/ I-391 Historical Overview from bostonroads.com]  {{3di|91}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Interstate 91-3}} [[Category:Auxiliary Interstate Highways|91-3]] [[Category:Interstate Highways in Massachusetts|91-3]] [[Category:Interstate 91|3]] [[Category:Transportation in Hampden County, Massachusetts]]</td></tr><tr><td>Bagrat VI of Georgia</td><td>3010702</td><td>651980907</td><td>2015-03-18T21:03:41.000+0000</td><td>Cplakidas</td><td>613068</td><td>'''Bagrat VI''' ({{lang-ka|ბაგრატ VI}}) ({{circa}} 1439 – 1478), a representative of the [[Imereti]]an branch of the [[Bagrationi]] royal house, was a [[Kingdom of Imereti|king of Imereti]] (as '''Bagrat II''') from 1463, and a [[List of the Kings of Georgia|king]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] from 1465 until his death.  ==Life== He was the son of Prince [[George, son of Constantine I of Georgia|George]]. Around 1455, he was granted the title of [[Eristavi]] (duke) of [[Samokalako]] ([[Kutaisi]], western Georgia, and the surroundings) by the Georgian king [[George VIII of Georgia|George VIII]]. In the early 1460s, Bagrat supported the rebel prince [[Qvarqvare I Jakeli]], [[atabeg]] of [[Samtskhe]], and the king took Bagrat's duchy away. In 1463, Bagrat led a coalition of western Georgian nobles who met and defeated George VIII at the [[Battle of Chikhori]]. Subsequently, Bagrat captured Kutaisi and was crowned king of [[Imereti]]. But in return for their aid, the new monarch was obliged to create a principality ('''''samtavro''''') for each of his four allies. Henceforth the [[Gelovani]] clan in [[Principality of Svaneti|Svaneti]], the [[Shervashidze]] (Sharvashidze) in [[Principality of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]], the [[Dadiani]] in [[Odishi]] (Mingrelia), and the [[House of Vardanisdze|Vardanidze]] in [[Principality of Guria|Guria]] ruled as semi-independent princes.  In 1465, after the king George VIII was defeated and imprisoned by Qvarqvare of Samtskhe, Bagrat used the opportunity to seize control of [[Tbilisi]]. Crowned king of Georgia, he ruled both [[Imereti]] in the west and [[Kingdom of Kartli (1484-1762)|Kartli]] in the east, but remained mostly in western Georgia. In his western possessions, he also established a separate church, [[Catholicosate of Abkhazia]], independent from the Patriarchate of [[Mtskheta]] (i.e., [[Georgian Orthodox Church]]). To justify this step, he asked [[Michael IV of Antioch|Michael IV]], [[List of Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch]] of [[Antioch]] and [[Jerusalem]], to compose a \"Law of Faith\" which stated that western and eastern Georgia had different history of conversion and, therefore, they should be independent from each other.  Once freed from captivity, George VIII attempted to recover his throne, but was only able to secure the eastern Georgian province [[Kakheti]], leaving the field in Kartli to his nephew, [[Constantine II of Georgia|Constantine]] who seems to have established himself as a virtual ruler in part of Kartli in 1469. During this time of triarchy, Georgia was at least twice [[Turkoman invasions of Georgia|attacked]] by [[Uzun Hasan]], the prince of the [[Ak Koyunlu]] clan ([[Münejjim Bashi]] speaks of three invasions, in 1466, in summer of 1472, and after Uzun Hassan's defeat by the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1476-7).<ref>[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] [http://www1.encislam.brill.nl/data/EncIslam/S8/SIM-7788.html article] on [[Uzun Hasan]]</ref> Bagrat had to make peace with the invaders, abandoning Tbilisi to the enemy. It was only after Uzun Hasan's death (1478) when the Georgians were able to recover their capital.  Bagrat died in 1478, and was succeeded by his son, [[Alexander II of Georgia|Alexander II]].  Bagrat VI was buried at the [[Gelati Monastery]] near [[Kutaisi]].  ==Family and children== He was married to Elene (died November 3, 1510), who bore him three sons: *Vakhtang (died very young) *[[Alexandre II of Georgia|Alexander II]] *David  ==Notes== {{Reflist}}  ==References== *Ivane Javakhishvili, ''The History of the Georgian Nation'', vol. 3 (1982), Tbilisi State University Press, pages 320–340 (In Georgian) *Ronald Grigor Suny, ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'': 2nd edition (December 1994), Indiana University Press, ISBN 0-253-20915-3, pages 45–46 *[http://www.4dw.net/royalark/Georgia/georgia3.htm Kings of Georgia at the ''Royal Ark'' website]  {{s-start}} {{s-bef | before=[[Demetre III|Demetre II]]}} {{s-ttl | title= [[Kingdom of Imereti|King of Imereti]] | years=1463–1478}} {{s-aft | rows=2 | after= [[Alexander II of Georgia|Alexander II]]}} {{s-bef | before = [[George VIII of Georgia|George VIII]]}} {{s-ttl | title= [[List of the Kings of Georgia|King of Georgia]] | years=1465–1478}} {{s-end}}  {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME              = Bagrat 06 of Georgia | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = King of Georgia | DATE OF BIRTH     = | PLACE OF BIRTH    = | DATE OF DEATH     = 1478 | PLACE OF DEATH    = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Bagrat 06 Of Georgia}} [[Category:Kings of Georgia (country)]] [[Category:Kings of Imereti]] [[Category:Orthodox monarchs]] [[Category:Bagrationi dynasty of the Kingdom of Georgia]] [[Category:1430s births]] [[Category:1478 deaths]]</td></tr><tr><td>Universidade Nova de Lisboa</td><td>2085757</td><td>681010104</td><td>2015-09-14T16:37:13.000+0000</td><td>Nova.comunica</td><td>15481131</td><td>{{refimprove|date=January 2013}} {{Infobox University |name              = NOVA |native_name       = Universidade Nova de Lisboa |image_name        = Universidade_Nova_de_Lisboa_logo.png  |image_size        = 250px |caption           = |latin_name        = |motto             = Omnis Civitas Contra Se Divisa Non Stabit |mottoeng          = All the city divided against itself will not remain |established       = 1973 |closed            = |type              = [[Public university|Public]] |affiliation       = |endowment         = |rector            = [[António Rendas]] |officer_in_charge = |chairman          = |chancellor        = |president         = |vice-president    = |superintendent    = |provost           = |vice_chancellor   = |principal         = |dean              = |director          = |head_label        = |head              = |faculty           = |staff             = |students          = over 19,000 (2014)<ref>http://www.unl.pt/guia/2014</ref> |undergrad         = |postgrad          = |doctoral          = |other             = |city              = [[Lisbon]] |state             = |province          = |country           = [[Portugal]] |coor              = |campus            = Main campus in Campolide, Lisbon and Caparica, Almada.

He began working in the chemical industry but was frustrated there.  He is quoted as saying, \"If you want to find something new, look for something new...there is a certain amount of risk in this attitude, as even the slightest failure tends to be resounding, but you are so happy when you succeed that it is worth taking the risk.\"<ref name=nyt/> In 1960, Chauvin began working for the [[French Institute of Petroleum|French Petroleum Institute]] in [[Rueil-Malmaison]]. He became honorary director of research there following his retirement from the institute in 1995. Chauvin also served as an emeritus (retired) director of research at the Lyon School of Chemistry, Physics, and Electronics.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>  == Awards and recognitions == He was awarded the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], along with [[Robert H.

In metathesis, chemists break double bonds more easily by introducing a catalyst—that is, a substance that starts or speeds up a chemical reaction. Chemists began performing metathesis in the 1950s without knowing exactly how the reaction worked. This lack of understanding hindered the search for more efficient catalysts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.humantouchofchemistry.com/yves-chauvin.htm | title=Humantouchofchemistry.com | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/211/000139791/ | title=NNDB | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>  In the early 1970s Chauvin achieved a breakthrough when he described the mechanism by which a [[Metal|metal atom]] bound to a carbon atom in one group of atoms causes the group to shift places with a group of atoms in another molecule and explained metathesis in detail. He showed that the reaction involves two [[double bond]]s. One of the double bonds connects two parts of an organic molecule. The other double bond connects a metal-based catalyst to a fragment of an organic molecule. In metathesis, these two double bonds combine and split to make four single bonds. The single bonds form a ring that connects the metal catalyst, the organic fragment, and the two parts of the organic molecule. The metal catalyst then breaks off from the ring, carrying away part of the organic molecule. This process leaves the fragment attached to the remainder of the [[organic molecule]] with a double bond, forming a new organic compound. Scholars have compared this reaction to a dance in which two sets of partners join hands to form a ring and then split apart again to form two new partnerships.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2005/chauvin-facts.html | title=NobelPrize.org | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciencia/2015/muere-nobel-yves-chauvin-100765.html | title=Eluniversal.com | accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>  Chauvin’s description of metathesis led [[Robert H. Grubbs]] and [[Richard R. Schrock]] to develop catalysts that carried out the reaction more efficiently. The three chemists’ work has enabled manufacturers to make organic compounds, including some plastics and medicines, using less energy because the required reaction pressures and temperatures became lower, and using fewer harmful and expensive chemicals, and creating fewer contaminant reaction [[by-products]] and [[hazardous waste]] that must be extracted from the desired synthetic. It was for this process they were awarded with 2005 Chemistry Nobel Prize.<ref>http://www.repubblica.it/scienze/2015/01/29/news/addio_a_yves_chauvin_nobel_per_la_chimica_2005-106070950/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2015/01/28/le-nobel-de-chimie-yves-chauvin-est-mort_4565396_1650684.html|title=Le Nobel de chimie Yves Chauvin est mort|work=Le Monde.fr}}</ref>  == Death == Chauvin died at the age of 84, on 27 January 2015 in [[Tours]], [[France]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/31/science/yves-chauvin-chemist-sharing-nobel-prize-dies-at-84.html | title=NYT | accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2015/01/chemistry-nobel-laureate-yves-chauvin-dies-olefin-metathesis Chemistry Nobel laureate Yves Chauvin dies aged 84]</ref>  ==Publications== {{refbegin}} * A.

The tradition of the Bargemaster dates back to 1215, with the signing of [[Magna Carta]] at [[Runnymede]].  The Bargemaster is responsible for the Royal Watermen, chosen from the ranks of the Thames Watermen, who operate tugs and launches on the river.

At the coronation, the Royal Watermen walk in the procession behind The Queen’s Bargemaster. At the [[State Opening of Parliament]], The Queen’s Bargemaster and four Royal Watermen travel as boxmen on coaches, guarding the regalia when it is conveyed from [[Buckingham Palace]] to [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] and back.  The privately owned charter vessel {{MV|Spirit of Chartwell}} was transformed into a royal barge for the Queen's use during her [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]].

It was one of several [[B-movie|B-films]] in which [[William Shatner]] starred between the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series and ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. Other cast members included [[Tom Skerritt]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Ida Lupino]], [[Keenan Wynn]] and [[John Travolta]] in his film debut in a minor role. [[Satanism|Satanist]] [[Anton LaVey]] is credited as the film's technical advisor and appeared in the film playing a minor role.  ==Plot summary== A [[curse]] affects the Preston family, caused by their betrayal of the Satanic priest Jonathan Corbis (Ernest Borgnine). Corbis has harassed the Preston family for generations to obtain a Satanic book of great power. Corbis captures patriarch Steve Preston, who is allowed to escape to warn his wife and younger son about Corbis's wrath. He tells them to give the book to Corbis, but during a rainstorm he melts into a waxy substance.  Mark Preston (Shatner) takes the book, hoping to meet with Corbis and defeat him. In a [[ghost town]] in the desert, Corbis gives Preston a drink of water from an old hand-pumped well. Preston drinks but then spits out the bitter water. He challenges Corbis to a battle of faith, then draws a pistol and aims it at him. Corbis belittles this threat and Preston tries to escape, but he is surrounded by Corbis' followers. He produces a cross, but Corbis transforms it into a snake and Preston discards it. Corbis' followers capture Preston, and Corbis uses a ritual to erase Preston's memory in preparation for a ceremony later that evening.  Preston's older brother, Tom (Tom Skerritt), and his wife, Julie, search for Mark. They are accompanied by Dr. Sam Richards (Albert), a psychic researcher. Their search leads them to Corbis' church, where Corbis is performing a ceremony to convert Mark into one of his soulless minions; during the proceedings Corbis transforms into a Satanic goat-like being. Tom witnesses all of this; he is discovered by the Satanists but eludes capture. Later he and Richards meet at the Satanic church, where they discover that the source of Corbis's power is an ornate glass bottle known as \"The Devil's Rain\", which contains the souls of Corbis's disciples.  Corbis and the Satanists converge on the church. Richards threatens to destroy The Devil's Rain, but he is overpowered by the acolytes. He appeals to Mark's lost humanity and convinces him to destroy the bottle, which he does in defiance of Corbis' entreaties. A storm rages outside, and the Satanists melt in the rain. Tom and his wife make a hasty exit. As Tom holds his wife, it is revealed that he is actually embracing Corbis, and his wife's soul has become trapped within a new Devil's Rain.  ==Cast== * [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Jonathan Corbis * [[Eddie Albert]] as Dr. Sam Richards * [[William Shatner]] as Mark Preston * [[Ida Lupino]] as Emma Preston * [[Tom Skerritt]] as Tom Preston * [[Joan Prather]] as Julie Preston * [[Keenan Wynn]] as Sheriff Owens * [[John Travolta]] as Danny * [[George Sawaya]] as Steve Preston * [[Anton LaVey]] as High Priest of the Church of Satan * [[Woodrow Chambliss]] as John  ==Response== ''The Devil's Rain'' received a uniformly negative critical response, with the chief complaint being the incoherent storyline. The film's refusal to provide adequate scares was also widely criticized. [[Vincent Canby]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that \"''The Devil's Rain'' is ostensibly a horror film, but it barely manages to be a horror...It is as horrible as watching an egg fry.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E1DF1E3AE034BC4053DFBE66838E669EDE|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=Film: ''The Devil's Rain''|date=August 8, 1975|accessdate=September 21, 2010|subscription=yes |work=The New York Times|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>  [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said \"All of this would be good silly fun if the movie weren't so painfully dull.

Fuest had previously directed ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]'' (1971), ''[[Dr. Phibes Rises Again]]'' (1972), and ''[[The Final Programme (film)|The Final Programme]]'' (1973). ''The Devil's Rain'' suffered such a critical drubbing that Fuest immediately was forced to retreat to [[television]], directing several nondescript [[Television movie|TV-movies]] and series episodes over the years. He has made only one additional theatrical feature, ''[[Aphrodite (film)|Aphrodite]]'' (1982), a softcore sex romp shot in [[Greece]].  In his 2010 book ''Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies'', Australian film reviewer Michael Adams ironically called ''The Devil's Rain'' \"the ultimate [[cult film|cult movie]]\": \"It's about a cult, has a cult following, was devised with input from a cult leader, and saw [[John Travolta|a future superstar]] indoctrinated into [[Scientology|a cult he'd help popularize]].\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Michael|title=Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies|chapter=That's Travolting!|page=107|isbn=978-0-06-180629-2|date=January 2010|publisher=''!t'' Books ([[HarperCollins]])}}</ref>  ==See also== * [[List of American films of 1975]]  ==Notes== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *{{AllMovie title|13543}} *{{IMDb title|id=0072869}}  {{Robert Fuest}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Devils Rain, The}} [[Category:1975 films]] [[Category:1975 horror films]] [[Category:American horror films]] [[Category:American films]] [[Category:English-language films]] [[Category:Films directed by Robert Fuest]] [[Category:Ghost films]] [[Category:Satanism in popular culture]]</td></tr><tr><td>Wildpark</td><td>2952555</td><td>544166436</td><td>2013-03-14T19:06:08.000+0000</td><td>Addbot</td><td>6569922</td><td>'''Wildpark''' may refer to:  *[[Wildparkstadion]], a sports arena in Karlsruhe, Germany *[[Wildpark, Derbyshire]]  {{Disambig}}  [[de:Wildpark]] {{Short pages monitor}}<!-- This long comment was added to the page to prevent it being listed on Special:Shortpages.

Despite his position atop the marquee, Sheene does not appear in about 80% of the film's footage.  Much of the filming of the race sequences with [[Barry Sheene]] took place at [[Donington Park]] race circuit close to [[East Midlands Airport]]. Many of the stunts were arranged by Stunt coordinator [[Roy Alon]].  ==Soundtrack== An outstanding feature of the film is the use of hit songs from the era as narration; songs such as \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]], \"Glittering Prize\" by [[Simple Minds]], and \"[[Hungry Like the Wolf]]\" by [[Duran Duran]] are used to add to the mood.  ==Home media== ''Space Riders'' was released on [[VHS]], but, as of 2013, not on [[DVD]].  ==See also== * ''[[Silver Dream Racer]]''  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== * {{IMDb title|0316649|Space Riders}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Space Riders}} [[Category:1984 films]] [[Category:1980s biographical films]] [[Category:1980s drama films]] [[Category:British films]] [[Category:British biographical films]] [[Category:British drama films]] [[Category:British sports films]] [[Category:English-language films]] [[Category:Films shot in Kent]] [[Category:Films shot in Italy]] [[Category:Films shot in London]] [[Category:Motorcycle racing films]]</td></tr><tr><td>Money, Marbles, and Chalk</td><td>2391890</td><td>468230576</td><td>2011-12-29T07:53:22.000+0000</td><td>Klemen Kocjancic</td><td>71061</td><td>{{Infobox song <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Songs --> | Name           = Money, Marbles, and Chalk | Cover          =  | Border         =  | Caption        =  | Type           =  | Artist         = Garner Eckler | alt Artist     = [[Patti Page]] | Album          =  | Published      =  | Released       =  | track_no       =  | Recorded       = 1949 | Genre          = Country music | Language       = English | Length         =  | Writer         = Garner Eckler | Composer       =  | Label          =  | Producer       =  | Tracks         =  | prev           =  | prev_no        =  | next           =  | next_no        =  | Misc           =  | Audio sample?  = }} \"'''Money, Marbles, and Chalk'''\" is a [[popular music|popular]] [[song]], written by Garner \"Pop\" Eckler in [[1949 in music|1949]].

The official corps song is ''[[Russian Christmas Music]]'' by [[Alfred Reed]], first played by the corps in 1977, the year they won their first national championship.<ref name=\"rep\"/>  ===Bones=== Part of the mystique surrounding the Crossmen are references to \"Bones.\"  Immediately prior to the Crossmen's performance at major shows, Bones appears at the top of the back stands or in another prominent place to help inspire the corps' performance. Dressed in a 1978 Crossmen [[uniform]] with ankle-length red [[cape]] and a skull [[mask]], Bones arrives as the corps enters the field, spreads his cape to audience approval, and then vanishes once the Crossmen begin their performance. Bones is considered by some people to be a [[mascot]] and apparent fan of the corps. The reality is that Bones is an unidentified alumnus who appears as a reminder of the corps' traditions.  Bones is also the nickname for the corps and for the members who have marched there. The corps' most prominent motto is \"When all else is gone, the Bones always remain.\"<ref name=\"trad\">http://drumcorpswiki.com/Crossmen</ref>  ===Unity=== Unity is extremely important in the Crossmen, and corps members rarely travel anywhere in uniform unless they are paired with another member; traditionally, they also always move during rehearsal in concert with a fellow corps member.<ref name=\"trad\"/>  ===Age Out Crosses=== At one time, members of the brass and percussion sections replaced the red crosses on their aussies with the white ones prior to their final performance, but this did unacceptable damage to the aussies. Due to the efforts of alumni and supporters, each age-out now receives a white cross on a necklace before that final performance, a keepsake which can be worn forever.<ref name=\"trad\"/>  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== *[http://www.crossmen.org Crossmen homepage] *[http://www.crossmenalumni.org Crossmen Alumni Association homepage] *[http://www.dci.org Drum Corps International]  {{DCI Nav}}  {start}  [[Category:Drum and bugle corps]] [[Category:DCI World Class corps]] [[Category:Musical groups from San Antonio, Texas]] [[Category:Musical groups established in 1975]] [[Category:1975 establishments in Pennsylvania]]</td></tr><tr><td>ABL (gene)</td><td>2412019</td><td>673036868</td><td>2015-07-25T16:40:29.000+0000</td><td>Trappist the monk</td><td>10289486</td><td>{{PBB|geneid=25}} '''Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1''' also known as '''ABL1''' is a [[protein]] that, in humans, is encoded by the ''ABL1'' [[gene]] (previous symbol ''ABL'') located on [[chromosome 9]].<ref name=\"pmid1857987\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Szczylik C, Skorski T, Nicolaides NC, Manzella L, Malaguarnera L, Venturelli D, Gewirtz AM, Calabretta B | title = Selective inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation by BCR-ABL antisense oligodeoxynucleotides | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5019 | pages = 562-5  | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1857987 | doi = 10.1126/science.1857987 }}</ref> c-Abl is sometimes used to refer to the version of the gene found within the mammalian genome, while v-Abl refers to the viral gene.  == Function ==  The ''ABL1'' [[Oncogene#Proto-oncogene|proto-oncogene]] encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein [[tyrosine kinase]] that has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, [[cell division]], [[cell adhesion]], and stress response.  Activity of ABL1 protein is negatively regulated by its [[SH3 domain]], and deletion of the SH3 domain turns ABL1 into an [[oncogene]].  The t(9;22) translocation results in the head-to-tail [[fusion gene|fusion]] of the ''[[BCR gene|BCR]]'' and ''ABL1'' genes, leading to a [[fusion gene]] present in many cases of chronic [[myelogenous leukemia]]. The DNA-binding activity of the ubiquitously expressed ABL1 tyrosine kinase is regulated by [[CDC2]]-mediated [[phosphorylation]], suggesting a cell cycle function for ABL1.  The ''ABL1'' gene is expressed as either a 6- or a 7-kb mRNA transcript, with alternatively spliced first exons spliced to the common exons 2-11.<ref>{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: ABL1 v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1| url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=gene&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=25| accessdate = }}</ref>  == Clinical significance == [[File:3CS9 Abl1 Nilotinib.png|250px|left|thumb|ABL1 kinase domain (blue) in complex with the second-generation [[Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor]] [[nilotinib]] (red)]] Mutations in the ''ABL1'' gene are associated with [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] (CML).  In CML, the gene is activated by being [[Chromosomal translocation|translocated]] within the [[BCR gene|BCR]] (breakpoint cluster region) [[gene]] on chromosome 22.  This new [[fusion gene]], ''BCR-ABL'', encodes an unregulated, cytoplasm-targeted tyrosine kinase that allows the cells to proliferate without being regulated by [[cytokines]]. This, in turn, allows the cell to become [[cancerous]].  This gene is a partner in a [[fusion gene]] with the ''BCR'' gene in the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], a characteristic abnormality in chronic [[myelogenous leukemia]] (CML) and rarely in some other [[leukemia]] forms. The BCR-ABL transcript encodes a [[tyrosine kinase]], which activates mediators of the [[cell cycle]] regulation system, leading to a clonal [[myeloproliferative disorder]]. The BCR-ABL protein can be inhibited by various small molecules.  One such inhibitor is [[imatinib|imatinib mesylate]], which occupies the tyrosine kinase domain and inhibits BCR-ABL's influence on the [[cell cycle]].  Second generation [[Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitor|BCR-ABL tyrosine-kinase inhibitor]]s are also under development to inhibit BCR-ABL mutants resistant to imatinib.  == Interactions ==  Abl gene has been shown to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with: {{div col|colwidth=15em}} * [[ABI1]],<ref name=pmid12672821>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tani K, Sato S, Sukezane T, Kojima H, Hirose H, Hanafusa H, Shishido T | title = Abl interactor 1 promotes tyrosine 296 phosphorylation of mammalian enabled (Mena) by c-Abl kinase | journal = J.

His missives impressed [[DC Comics]] editor [[Julius Schwartz]] enough for Schwartz expand the letter columns in some titles to a second, separate page (such as \"Flash-Grams — Extra\", \"Letters To the Batcave — Extra\", and \"JLA Mailroom — Special Peter Sanderson Edition\") to facilitate Sanderson's analysis.<ref>Hembeck, Fred.

Retrieved July 2, 2008.</ref> In the early 1980s Sanderson wrote for comic [[fanzine]]s.  From there, Sanderson broke into the comic book industry proper; he was first hired by DC Comics, where he was given the task of reading every comic book published by the company since 1935. His research was used by [[Len Wein]] to write ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe]]''.<ref>[http://www.lib.msu.edu/comics/rri/srri/sanderso.htm Index to Comic Art Collection]</ref> Sanderson then went to work for Marvel as their first (and only) [[archivist]],<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Marvel-Vault-Museum-book-Collectibles/dp/product-description/0762428449 Marvel Vault]</ref> and contributed as a researcher on the various ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' series in the 1980s and early 1990s.  Sanderson was also the writer of the ''[[Marvel Saga]]'' and ''[[Wolverine Saga]]'' [[limited series]]. These titles did not follow the typical art-centered comic book format; instead, the two series focused on text chronicling the fictional histories of comic book characters — rather than writing new exploits of the characters — that Sanderson culled from previous titles Marvel had published over the years. The text was supplemented by individual [[Panel (comics)|panels]] excerpted from the comic books that served as Sanderson's sources.  He writes an online column entitled ''Comics in Context'', which (in Sanderson's own words) is \"a weekly series of critical essays on comics, cartoon art, and related subjects\"<ref name=cineplex>[http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/2006/06/23/comics-in-context-134-cineplex-men/print/ Comics in Context #134: Cineplex-Men]</ref> (those \"related subjects\" can run the gamut from [[List of films based on comics|film adaptations of comic books]], to other media that have been influenced by comics, such as ''[[Star Wars]]''). The series started on July 8, 2003 on the website ''[[IGN]].com'', but then moved to the [[Kevin Smith]]-affiliated website ''Quick Stop Entertainment'' on June 23, 2006; according to Mr. Sanderson, the \"Powers That Be\" in charge of IGN's comics section began to tamper with the titles of his columns and complain about some of the topics he covered, whereby a \"change of scenery\" was necessary.<ref name=\"cineplex\" /> After a seventeen-month hiatus, ''Comics in Context'' returned to the newly-rebranded ''[[Fred Entertainment|A Site Called Fred]]'' on January 19, 2010.<ref>[http://www.asitecalledfred.com/2010/01/19/comics-in-context-outfoxed/ A Site Called Fred]</ref>  Outside of his online writings, Sanderson has also had a number of books published (including ''The Marvel Vault'' and ''The Marvel Travel Guide to New York''),<ref>[http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2008/01/03/the-beats-annual-survey-2008-edition-part-2/ The Beat’s Annual Survey 2008 Edition Part 2]</ref> taught the class ''The Graphic Novel as Literature'' at [[New York University]],<ref>[http://www.scps.nyu.edu/export/sites/scps/pdf/bulletin/spring-2008/scps-humanities.pdf NEWYORKUNIVERSITYBULLETIN]</ref> [[Curator|curated]] an exhibition on [[Stan Lee]] for the [[Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art]],<ref>[http://www.moccany.org/exhibit-stanlee.html MoCCA]</ref> and reviews the latest in comics and comics-related material for ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.  ==Bibliography==  ===Comics=== *''[[Marvel Saga]]'': ** ''[[Essential Marvel]] Saga: Volume 1'' (440 pages, January 2008, ISBN 0-7851-2727-5) ** ''Essential Marvel Saga: Volume 2'' (472 pages, December 2008, ISBN 0-7851-2728-3)  ===Books=== *''Marvel Universe: The Complete Encyclopedia of Marvel's Greatest Characters'' (256 pages, Harry N.

Fortescue''' (who was ''not'' born 1868) was a nonexistent [[United States|US]] surgeon and founder of the '''International Board of Hygiene''' that the [[League of Nations]] recognised in 1926.  Honorable J. Fortescue was a brainchild of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] pathologist '''Rawson Pickard'''. The International Board of Hygiene was little else than a group of drinking friends who had founded it in a Turf Bar in [[Tijuana]], [[Baja California]], during the [[Prohibition]]. The original Sir [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]] (1385-1479) was an English lawyer.  Because most of the meetings were organised outside the borders of the USA, the Board had to be international, and because many of the members were medical professionals, its theme was [[hygiene]] (The League of Nations already had its own International Board of Health). Anyone who had attended the meeting once became a lifetime member. On October 21, 1926 Pickard sent a long letter to the League of Nations HQ in Geneva and received recognition in a couple of weeks.  In the following years, various organisations and publications expressed interest about the Board and its reclusive president Fortescue. The [[United States National Research Council]] included him in a directory of child psychologists and he was invited to join the [[American Conference on Hospital Service]]. Pickard wrote very many articles in Fortescue's name and answered journalistic enquiries in his stead. Apparently none of the recipients ever bothered to check his credentials.  At the same time, the membership of the International Board of Hygiene spread by invitation. Every meeting was concluded with the reading of a scientific paper.   In 1936 ''Who's Who in San Diego'' included an entry about Fortescue, listing his multiple publications, memberships in associations, medical studies and travels, including winning the Fleischmann prize (actually a letter-writing contest for [[Fleischmann's Yeast]]). It also claimed that his mother was [[Lola Montez]] and that he lived in Paris. His only official address was \"The International Board of Hygiene, 1908 Eutaw Place, [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]\". Some of the studies would have been really groundbreaking at the time, preceding such scientific studies like [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction|Kinsey surveys]].

They were founded in 1936, and since then they have spent 41 seasons in the [[Liga I|top-flight]]. Brașov kits are yellow-black, and they play their home matches on the [[Stadionul Silviu Ploeșteanu|Silviu Ploeșteanu]] stadium.  ==History==  ===Early modern football in Brașov=== \"Prehistoric\" football in Brașov started between 1912 and 1914. In 1927, the unrelated [[Colțea Brașov]] won a major title. In the second edition of Division C (1937–1938), the team Brașovia had given way to the new team \"Astra\" Brașov, founded a year earlier in 1936, which developed through the years to the current team from the foot of the mountain Tâmpa, FC Brașov. Players from this precursor of FC's in '37 may be considered the first generation in the team history. Ten of them are mentioned by the press: Năftănăilă (no relation to Lulu Năftănăilă from the later history of the club), Aurel Stroe, Pitu, Chicomban (a known family of multiathletes), Danciu, Pedra, Chirică, Dumitrescu, A. Iftimie, Dănăilă, Dragan.  ===The generation of Silviu Ploeșteanu=== The Second World War paralyzed the world of football, although there were a few competitions like \"The Cup of Bessarabia\" or \"The Heroes Cup\". Immediately after the armistice, various teams began to emerge throughout Romania, for the most part related to industrial establishments, universities or the military.  Yet one more time we find the Brașov team in Division C – series XII, as \"UAB\". This constellation is the starting point of the team that manager Silviu Ploeșteanu, with firm hands and professionalism, will bring to the second place in the first division and to winning the first Balkan Interclub Cup. We consider this to be the second generation, the generation that finally succeeded to break into Division B, in 1950.  This is the generation that Silviu Ploeșteanu managed to become a great team, winners of \"The Balkan Cup\" and players on the front stage among Romanian clubs. In 1960 the team places itself as number two on the front stage. This is the generation of Nicolae Proca, Gheorghe Fusulan, Gheorghe Ciripoi, Tică Constantinescu, Gheorghe Percea, Octavian Zaharia and Gheorghe Raicu; later supplemented by Stephen Hidișan (who continued as coach, a discoverer of talent), Nicolae Campo, Ioan Szigeti, Alexandru Meszaroși, Vasile Szeredai, Dorin Gane, Valer Târnăveanu and Necula Dorin.  ===The generation of the Mexican trio=== The following generation is the one of the trio [[Nicolae Pescaru]] – [[Stere Adamache]] – [[Mihai Ivăncescu]], the generation that provided three players to the Romanian national team at the World Cup in Mexico 1970. For a province team this was an extraordinary achievement, especially as they then played in Division B, even if the demotion (starting in 1968) was due to factors unrelated to the playing proficiency of the team.  The death of Iuliu Năftănăilă on 28 August 1967 gave the club a terrible shock from which it did not recover. Not only had Brașov lost one of its greatest talents, there was also the obtuseness of the federation, which did not agree to postpone the match with U Cluj just 48 hours after the funeral. Still under psychological pressure, the team gave up and could not recover fast enough. This demotion resulted in the replacement of Silviu Ploeșteanu as the coach of the team. After only eight stages on the bench in the next edition of \"B\", Valentin Stănescu was assigned his position. The shock of being dismissed from the team that he had managed for 21 years led to his death in the following spring, on 13 April 1969.  This generation links to the names of Csaba Gyorffy, Iuliu Jenei, Călin Gane, Marcel Goran, Pete Cadar, Caesar Ardeleanu, Adrian Hârlab and Virgil Grecea – a generation consisting of some of the most long term team members.  ===The generation of the '80s=== <!--[[File:FC Braşov 1980s logo.svg|thumb|left|100px|FC Braşov's crest during the 1980s]]--> The generation of the '80s brought the team back on the first stage, after five years of penance in the second division. This was the generation of Vasile Papuc, Vasile Gherghe, Marian Paraschivescu, Valer Șulea, Costel Spirea, Vasile Bențea, Gherasim Chioreanu, Adrian Furnică, Constantin Manciu, Nicolae Bucur, Nicolae Adami, Mihai Panache and Petre Marinescu.  Others incorporated along the way were Marius Lăcătuș, Ion Batacliu, Nistor Văidean, Ion Mandoca and Dumitru Stângaciu, a generation that demoted the team into \"B\" for a season, but that also brought it back. They did not reach the foremost positions, as had the earlier generations, but still for a long time they maintained the flag of Brașov on mast-head. The generation of the '80s continued and merged with the generation of the end of the decade, when new stars appeared on the Brașov sky: Marin Barbu, Alexandru Csaba Andrași, Marian Mărgărit, Eugen Moldovan, Petre Lucian, Andrei Șanta and Ștefan Bălan.  ===A leap in the line of time and the World Cup of '94=== <!--[[File:FC Braşov old logo.svg|thumb|left|100px|Club logo during the 90's]]--> After the events of December '89, we reach the generation that sent Marian Ivan to the '94 World Cup in the USA. This is the generation of [[Tibor Selymes]], Ionel Pârvu, Laszlo Polgar, Emil Spirea, Sandu Andrași, Iulian Chiriță, Dorel Purdea, and Marius Todericiu, a generation that still had some of the most worthy players of previous generations. This is the generation which, as previously said, sent Marian Ivan to the World Cup, 24 years after the Mexican trio.  ===The new generation, an indigenous one=== Some of the players of previous generations came to the foot of Tâmpa from elsewhere, adapted and remained faithful to these lands, along with those that were born and formed here. In recent years, the junior teams of \"the flagmen\" have begun to produce young talents one after the other. The best of the best have been incorporated into the \"big\" group, others have been lent to teams in the lower categories, to grind. Traian Alexandru Marc, Marius Constantin, Romeo Surdu, Ioan Coman, Silviu Pintea, Ionuț Vasiliu and Dragoș Luca – the generation formed by \"Municipal\" or \"ICIM\", the generation that brought the titles of champions or vice-champions back to Brașov after a very long time. This generation was thrown into battle together with others that committed themselves to the fields of Brașov: Aurel Ghindaru, Vasile Ghindaru, Mugurel Buga, Laszlo Balint, Emerich Vascko, Cosmin Bodea, Daniel Isăilă, Octavian Cocan,Marcel Șandor, Mihai Stere, Robert Dani, Florin Stângă and the list could go on and on. A list that is sure to be filled with other names coming from the juniors, carefully prepared within the framework of the \"center\".  At the end of the 2008–09 season, the team finished 9th in the [[Liga I]].  ===2009–10 season=== The club started the 2009–10 season very well, ranking 1st in the [[2009–10 Liga I|championship]] at the end of the first 10 matches, with 7 points behind the 2nd placed team. In the [[2009–10 Cupa României|Romanian Cup]], they managed to reach the semi-finals, after eliminating one by one, [[CS Otopeni]], [[Unirea Urziceni]] and [[Gloria Bistrița]]. By doing this, they managed to equalize their all time best performance in this competition, after the ones achieved in the [[1951 Cupa României|1951]], [[1957–58 Cupa României|1957–58]], [[1961–62 Cupa României|1961–62]], [[1969–70 Cupa României|1969–70]], [[1978–79 Cupa României|1978–79]] and the [[1986–87 Cupa României|1986–87]] seasons. They were drawn against [[FC Vaslui]]. Neither team had ever reached the final before. FC Brașov lost the encounter.  ==Current squad== :''As of 26 August 2015''  {{Fs start}} {{Fs player|no= 1|nat=ROU|name=[[Alexandru Tănase (footballer)|Alexandru Tănase]]|pos=GK}} {{Fs player|no= 2|nat=ROU|name=[[Andrei Poverlovici]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no= 4|nat=ROU|name=[[Ionuţ Hlinca]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no= 5|nat=ROU|name=[[Şerban Moraru]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no= 6|nat=ROU|name=[[Adrian Puțanu]]|pos=DF|other=<small>on loan from [[FC Viitorul Constanţa|Viitorul]]</small>}} {{Fs player|no= 7|nat=ROU|name=[[Claudiu Codoban]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no= 8|nat=ROU|name=[[Vlad Olteanu]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no= 9|nat=ROU|name=[[Marius Matei]]|pos=FW}} {{Fs player|no=10|nat=ROU|name=[[Bogdan Rusu]]|pos=FW}} {{Fs player|no=13|nat=ROU|name=[[Daniel Mutu]]|pos=GK}} {{Fs player|no=15|nat=ROU|name=[[Daniel Ene]]|pos=FW}} {{Fs player|no=16|nat=ROU|name=[[Cosmin Letan]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs mid}} {{Fs player|no=17|nat=ROU|name=[[Horia Popa]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=18|nat=ROU|name=[[Ciprian Perju]]|pos=DF|other=<small>on loan from [[FC Viitorul Constanţa|Viitorul]]</small>}} {{Fs player|no=20|nat=ROU|name=[[Sebastian Ianc]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=21|nat=ROU|name=[[George Mareș]]|pos=FW|other=<small>on loan from [[FC Petrolul Ploiești|Petrolul]]</small>}} {{Fs player|no=22|nat=ROU|name=[[Alexandru David]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no=23|nat=ROU|name=[[Mihai Istrofor]]|pos=DF}} {{Fs player|no=27|nat=ROU|name=[[Alexandru Burlacu]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Mugurel Buga]]|pos=FW|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}} {{Fs player|no=30|nat=ROU|name=[[Răzvan Avram]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=57|nat=ROM|name=[[Vlad Munteanu(Neagoe)|Vlad Munteanu]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs player|no=96|nat=ROU|name=[[Bogdan Căucă]]|pos=GK}} {{Fs player|no=97|nat=ROU|name=[[Claudiu Pamfile]]|pos=MF}} {{Fs end}}  ===Out on loan=== {{Fs start}} {{Fs player|no=|nat=ROU|name=[[George Monea]]|pos=MF|other=at [[CS Unirea Tărlungeni|Unirea Tărlungeni]]}} {{Fs player|no=|nat=ROU|name=[[Andrei Ispas]]|pos=MF|other=at [[Metalurgistul Cugir]]}} {{Fs mid}} {{Fs player|no=|nat=ROU|name=[[Vlad Boţia]]|pos=MF|other=at [[AFC Hărman]]}} {{Fs player|no=|nat=ROU|name=[[Dragoş Bleambu]]|pos=FW|other=at [[AFC Hărman]]}} {{Fs end}}  == Club Officials == {{col-begin}} {{col-4}} === Board of directors === {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Role ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Name |- | Owner | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Ioan Neculaie |- | Honorary President | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Romeo Paşcu |- | President | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Vasile Dochiţa |- | Managing Director | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Ilie Vâju |} {{col-4}}  === Current technical staff === {| class=\"toccolours\" |- ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Role ! style=\"background:silver;\" |Name |- | Manager | {{Flagicon|ROU}} [[Adrian Szabo]] |- | Assistant Manager | {{Flagicon|ROU}} [[Mihai Stere]] |- | Goalkeeping Coach | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Andrei Şanta |- | Fitness Coach | {{Flagicon|ROU}} Lucian Nicolau |} {{col-end}}  ==Honours==  ===Domestic=== <!--[[File:Liga I logo.png|20px]]-->'''[[Liga I]]''' *Runners-up (1): [[Divizia A 1959–60|1959–60]] [[File:Campioana Romania.png|20px]] '''[[Liga II]]''' *'''Winners (6):''' [[1956 Divizia B|1956]], [[1968–69 Divizia B|1968–69]], [[1979–80 Divizia B|1979–80]], [[1983–84 Divizia B|1983–84]], [[1998–99 Divizia B|1998–99]], [[2007–08 Liga II|2007–08]] *Runners-up (2): [[1976–77 Divizia B|1976–77]], [[1978–79 Divizia B|1978–79]]  ===European=== '''[[Balkans Cup]]''' *'''Winners (1):''' [[1960–61 Balkans Cup|1960–61]]  ==European record== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Historically, flattery has been used as a standard form of discourse when addressing a [[monarch|king]] or [[queen regnant|queen]]. In the [[Renaissance]], it was a common practice among writers to '''flatter''' the reigning monarch, as [[Edmund Spenser]] flattered [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[William Shakespeare]] flattered [[James I of England|King James I]] in ''[[Macbeth]]'' and [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] flattered [[Lorenzo II de' Medici]] in ''[[The Prince]]''.  Flattery is also used in [[pick-up line]]s when attempting to initiate romantic courtship.  Most associations with flattery, however, are negative. Negative descriptions of flattery range at least as far back in history as [[The Bible]]. In the [[Divine Comedy]], Dante depicts flatterers wading in human excrement, stating that their words were the equivalent of excrement, in the [[Inferno (Dante)|8th Circle of Hell]].  An insincere flatterer is a [[stock character]] in many literary works. Examples include [[Gríma Wormtongue|Wormtongue]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Goneril]] and [[Regan]] from ''[[King Lear]]'', and [[Iago]] from ''[[Othello]]''.  Historians and philosophers have paid attention to flattery as a problem in ethics and politics.  [[Plutarch]] wrote an essay on \"How to Tell a Flatterer from a Friend.\"  [[Julius Caesar]] was notorious for his flattery.  In his [[Praise of Folly]], [[Erasmus]] commended flattery because it \"raises downcast spirits, comforts the sad, rouses the apathetic, stirs up the stolid, cheers the sick, restrains the headstrong, brings lovers together and keeps them united.\" <ref> Regier, Willis Goth. ''In Praise of Flattery'' (Lincoln:  University of Nebraska Press, 2007).</ref>  \"To flatter\" is also used to refer to artwork or clothing that makes the subject or wearer appear more attractive, as in:  * The King was pleased with the portrait, as it was very flattering of his girth. * I think I'll wear the green dress because it flatters my legs.  ==See also== * [[Appeal to flattery]] * [[Ingratiation]] * [[Love bombing]] * [[Superficial charm]] * [[Sycophancy]]  ==References== {{Reflist}}  ==External links== {{wikiquote}} {{Wiktionary|flattery|flatter}} * [http://www.giga-usa.com/gigaweb1/quotes2/qutopflatteryx001.htm Quotes about flattery]    [[Category:Interpersonal relationships]] [[Category:Persuasion techniques]]</td></tr><tr><td>Boris Turayev</td><td>2441191</td><td>675929849</td><td>2015-08-13T16:33:48.000+0000</td><td>Xenophon401</td><td>25646671</td><td>[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary B82 55-4.jpg|thumb|Boris Turayev.]]  '''Boris Alexandrovich Turayev''' ({{lang-ru|Бори́с Алекса́ндрович Тура́ев}}; {{OldStyleDate|August 5|1868|July 24}}, [[Navahrudak]] – July&nbsp;23, 1920, [[Petrograd]]) was a [[Russia]]n scholar who studied the [[Ancient Near East]] (mainly [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Nubia]]).

Since 1896, he delivered lectures at the [[University of St Petersburg]]. He was an ordinary professor of this university since 1911.

Some of the 1985-87 B230F-equipped [[Volvo 740|740]]'s came with a [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]]-made gearbox (designated by a gearshift labeled \"P R N D 3 2 1\"). The AW70 (gearshift labeled \"P R N D 2 1\" with a side-mounted overdrive lockout) is widely considered significantly more reliable than the [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] transmission.  ==AW71==  The AW71 and AW71L was a strengthened version of the AW70 transmission used in the [[Volvo]] [[volvo 760|760]], [[volvo 940|940]], and some [[volvo 740|740]]'s and [[volvo 240|240]]'s with turbocharged and higher-output naturally aspirated engines.  Some have been seen in 1985-87 [[Volvo 240|240]]'s with the B230F engine.  Also was used in late model European-spec [[Volvo]] [[Volvo 260|260]] series cars.  North American market [[Volvo]] [[Volvo 260|260]] cars used the Borg Warner Type 55 transmission.  Identical to the [[Toyota]] A43D and A43DL except with different tailshaft housings (switchable) and tailshaft flanges (removable).  ==AW72==  An automatic [[gearbox]] built by [[Aisin]] of Japan used the [[Volvo]] 16-valve B234F 4-cylinder engine found in the 740 GLE. This gearbox is a modified AW71 with different ratios to leverage the unique power curve characteristics produced by the 16-valve head (when compared to the 8-valve B230F/FT with an AW71 gearbox).  ==Gear Ratios<ref>http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1986/1986_240/86240_04.htm</ref><ref>http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1990/1990_740/90740_24.htm</ref>==  {| border=\"1\" !

It was broadcast every Saturday evening on [[GMA Network|GMA]]. The format is loosely patterned on the original ''[[Tawag ng Tanghalan]]''.  The program was hosted by [[Regine Velasquez]].  In the 2006 Star Awards for Television, Velasquez was awarded the \"Best Talent Search Program Host\" for the show.  ==Overview==  ===Format=== The competition begins with a long audition period; then for forty weeks, three contestants would compete each week in front of a panel of judges. The weekly winner challenges the winner the week before. The winner must be able to defend his or her title for four consecutive weeks in order to automatically qualify for the grand final at the end of the forty weeks. Then, a Pinoy Pop Superstar grand champion is crowned. The first two seasons' grand showdown took place in [[Araneta Coliseum]] on May 2005 and 2006 respectively, and was judged by [[Floy Quintos]], [[Jaya (singer)|Jaya]], [[Danny Tan]], [[Kyla]], and [[Jay-R]].  On the third season, however, there had become new rules. After the three contenders sing their songs on their own rendition, the second round would force them to sing their song, but not in their music type. For the weekly winner of four consecutive weeks, he or she will qualify for the prelimination showdown. The remaining finalists will compete for the grand showdown.  Rules were then again changed after the Pinoy Pop Superstar Year 3 Special: Fast Forward to Superstardom ''(this special consists of 12 wildcard finalists wherein Joyce Tanana won)''. On the first round, six contenders sing their song in favor to their capacity and genre. Three of them will be eliminated with judges' average scores. On the second round, the remaining three contenders will sing a different kind/genre of song. The weekly challenger will compete with the defending winner. The winner shall defend his title for four consecutive weeks ''(this time the defending winner can only reign his title for four weeks)''. The gathered finalists will compete for the grand showdown.  ===Prizes=== The prizes at stake include a house (from Crown Asia in 2005 and Filinvest in 2006), a car ([[Toyota Innova]] in 2005 and [[Chevrolet Optra]] in 2006), a recording contract with [[GMA Records]], and 1,000,000 [[Philippine peso|pesos]].  ==Season synopses==  ===Grand Contenders=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

It was originally recorded for the group's 1989 album ''[[Automatic (The Jesus and Mary Chain album)|Automatic]]'' and was released as a single in November 1989.  ==Background== In the UK, it was released in seven different formats, including four 7\" singles. One 7\" single was released per week, and one of them included a cardboard box to house the full set.  Although the song only made it up to #57 in the country where the band first found fame, the [[United Kingdom]], it peaked at #2 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in the [[United States]].  The song has been covered by several other groups, most notably the American alternative rock band [[Pixies]] on their fourth studio album, ''[[Trompe Le Monde]]''.  ==Musical style== Denise Sullivan of [[Allmusic]] described the song as a \"blueprint [[post-punk]] in the tradition of [[Joy Division]]/[[New Order]].\"<ref name=\"all1\"/> The song relies on a [[Keyboard bass|synth bass]] and a [[drum machine]],<ref name=\"popp\">{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/178388-makes-you-want-to-feel-the-jesus-and-mary-chains-head-on/ | title=Makes You Want to Feel: The Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Head On\" | publisher=[[PopMatters]] | date=January 21, 2014 | accessdate=November 24, 2014 | author=Ramirez, AJ}}</ref> latter of which provides a [[Pop music|pop]]-influenced [[New wave music|new wave]] beat.<ref name=\"all1\"/> While the song lacks the layers of [[guitar feedback]] of the band's previous works, it features a \"1950s-style riff,\" provided by [[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]].<ref name=\"popp\"/> The song's style was also compared to the sound of [[Beach Boys]].<ref name=\"all1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/head-on-mt0030443285 | title=The Jesus and Mary Chain - Head On | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=November 24, 2014 | author=Sullivan, Denise}}</ref>   ==Track listing== All tracks written by [[Jim Reid]] and [[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]], except where noted.  ;7\" (NEG42) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"In The Black\" - 2:59  ;7\" (NEG42XB) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"Terminal Beach\" - 2:25  ;7\" (NEG42Y) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"Deviant Slice\" - 3:00  ;7\" (NEG42Z) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"I'm Glad I Never\" ([[Lee Hazlewood]]) - 1:31  ;12\" (NEG42TE) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"In The Black\" - 2:59 # \"Terminal Beach\" - 2:25  ;CD3 (NEG42CD) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"In The Black\" - 2:59 # \"Drop <small>(Acoustic Remix)</small>\" - 1:52 # \"Break Me Down\" - 2:29  ;Cassette (NEG42C) # \"Head On\" - 4:11 # \"In The Black\" - 2:59  ==Personnel== ===The Jesus and Mary Chain=== *[[Jim Reid]] - [[Singing|vocals]], [[guitar]], [[synthesizer]], [[drum machine|drum programming]], [[Record producer|producer]] *[[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]] - guitar, synthesizer, drum programming, producer  ===Additional personnel=== *[[Alan Moulder]] - [[Audio Engineering|engineer]] (\"Head On\", \"Drop\")  ==Pixies cover== {{Infobox single | Name           = Head On | Cover          = Pixiesheadon.jpg | Alt            =  | Artist         = [[Pixies]] | Album          = [[Trompe le Monde]] | A-side         = \"Head On\" (Single Mix) | B-side         = \"Planet of Sound\" (Live)<br> \"Tame\" (Live)<br> \"Debaser\" (Live) | Released       = {{Start date|df=yes|1991}} | Format         = [[7\"]], [[Cassette single|cassette]], [[CD single|CD]] | Recorded       = 1991<br> Master Control, [[Burbank, California|Burbank]];<br> [[Pacifique Recording Studios|Pacifique]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]];<br> Studio des dames, [[Paris]];<br> [[Blackwing Studios]], [[London]]. | Genre          = [[Alternative rock]] | Length         = 2:14 | Label          = [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] | Writer         = [[Jim Reid]] and [[William Reid (musician)|William Reid]] | Producer       = [[Gil Norton]] | Last single    = \"[[Letter to Memphis]]\"<br />(1991) | This single    = \"'''Head On'''\"<br />(1991) | Next single    = \"[[Debaser]]\"<br />(1997) }} \"Head On\" was [[Cover version|covered]] by the [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Pixies]] for their 1991 album ''[[Trompe le Monde]]''. The Pixies' version was released as a [[single (music)|single]] in 1991.  ===Video=== By 1991, the Pixies refused to film [[music video]]s for their singles. After a long debate with their record company in the United States &mdash; [[Elektra Records]] &mdash; the band relented and agreed to film a video, as long as the song was done completely live. Peter Lubin, the A&R representative of Elektra at the time, later explained the situation:<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 157</ref>  {{cquote|By completely live that means full band, vocals, cameras roll, video's done by the end of two minutes and 13 seconds. One take, that's it. So those became the ground rules, that was the only way you were going to get a Pixies video for 'Head On' or anything else.}}  Lubin then came up with the idea for the video. Twelve cameras would be placed, \"dividing\" each band member into three blocks. Frontman [[Black Francis]] was happy with this idea, so [[Scott Litt]] was then hired to produce the video.<ref name=\"fg158\">Frank, Ganz, 2005. p. 158</ref><!-- Describe video --> After the video had been filmed, Elektra invited the \"whole decision-making team from [[MTV]]\" to view it. \"Head On\"'s video was then added onto MTV's rotation, with the video later receiving the \"Breakthrough Video\" award.<ref name=\"fg158 \"/>  ===Pixies' track listing=== All songs written by [[Black Francis]], except where noted #\"Head On\" (Single Mix) (Jim Reid and William Reid)&nbsp;– 2:20 #\"[[Planet of Sound]]\" (Live at [[Brixton Academy]], 26 July 1991)&nbsp;– 2:26 #\"Tame\" (Live at Brixton Academy, 26 July 1991)&nbsp;– 2:27 #\"[[Debaser]]\" (Live in Chicago, 9 August 1989)&nbsp;– 2:41  ==References== *Frank, Josh; Ganz, Caryn. \"[[Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies]].\" Virgin Books, 2005.

It was formed in 1963 at [[Carleton College]], [[Northfield, Minnesota]] as a humorous protest against the college's required attendance of religious services.<ref>[[#Tys92|Tyson 1992]]. p. 153.</ref> This original congregation is called the Carleton Grove, sometimes the Mother Grove. There are over 40 groves and proto-groves of the RDNA throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. As of 2005 there were approximately 400 grove members, between 2500 and 4000 Druids, and about 100 priests and priestesses.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}  ==History==  ===Origins=== A liberal arts college, Carleton had been founded by the [[Congregational Church]], but by the 1960s had become a non-denominational institution. Nonetheless, it still held a rule that \"attendance is required at the College Service of Worship or at the Sunday Evening Program or at any regularly organized service of public worship.\"<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 152.</ref> A number of students, including David Fisher, David Frangquist, Howard Cherniack, Jan Johnson and Norman Nelson believed that this rule was unnecessary, and as a form of protest decided to form their own religious group rather than attend any of the already existing ones. Thus they created the RDNA, having meetings near the athletic fields on the college grounds, and filled in this information on their obligatory 'chapel slips'.<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 152-153.</ref> As Nelson remarked, \"The sole motive was to protest the requirement, not to try for alternatives for worship… There was never any intention to mock any religion; it was not intended that RDNA should compete with or supplant any faith. We tried to write a service which could be attended 'in good faith' by anyone.\"<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 153.</ref>  The RDNA believed that the college authorities would have to accept theirs as a valid form of worship, and that if they didn't then they would be guilty of hypocrisy.<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 153.</ref> The dean of men did nothing, choosing to ignore the group, neither accepting their chapel slips nor taking disciplinary action against them. The dean of women on the other hand chose to accept the chapel slips submitted by the two female members of the RDNA.<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 153.</ref> In 1964, the college abolished the rule requiring the attendance of religious services, and the college's President Nason and his wife actually chose to attend the final RDNA ceremony of that academic year. Nason failed to point out that the consumption of whiskey was a part of the rite despite the fact that the consumption of alcoholic drinks was against the college rules.<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 153-154.</ref>  After extended discussion with the Druids, the college recognized that its position was untenable, and, in part because of the challenge from the Druids, the religious requirement was dropped in June, 1964. But in creating an effective vehicle to challenge the requirement, the founders had unwittingly fostered an environment for spiritual exploration that many found rewarding. For many Druids the movement had come to represent a valuable part of their spiritual lives, and the founders were stunned to discover that the demand for Druid services continued even after the college requirement disappeared.<ref>[[#Tys92|Tyson 1992]]. p. 153.</ref>  ==Principles== Reformed Druidism emphasizes its lack of institutionalized dogma. Each Druid is required only to adopt these basic tenets: *One of the many ways in which the object of Man’s search for religious truth can be found is through Nature. *Nature, being one of the primary concerns in Man’s life and struggle, and being one of the objects of Creation, is important to Man’s spiritual quests.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  The original group were not Neo-Pagan — most identified themselves as Jewish, Christian, agnostic, atheist, Marxist or as members of other faiths<ref>[[#Bon06|Bonewits 2006]], p. 89</ref> — and the movement still includes many who do not consider themselves Neo-Pagan.  [[Chas S. Clifton]], an academic scholar of Neopaganism, made several suggestions as to where the early RDNA founders may have got their ideas about Druidry from, noting that there were British Druid groups such as the [[Ancient Druid Order]] operating at the time, who held annual ceremonies at the megalithic monument of [[Stonehenge]] in Wiltshire, attracting much media attention. Accompanying this, there were ideas about the ancient druids to be found in the \"American literary consciousness\", where they appeared as guardians of the natural world in the Romanticist poetry of [[Philip Freneau]].<ref>[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. p. 153.</ref>  Clifton's speculations are in contrast to the actual motivations for Reformed Druidism. In fact,  at a meeting in Fisher's dormitory room about the religious requirement, Cherniack volunteered that his family had always responded to questions about religion by claiming to be Druids, and the group adopted this moniker.  When someone pointed out that none of the group knew anything at all about Druids, the suggestion quickly arose that the new group call itself The '''Reformed''' Druids '''of North America''', so it could create tenets and rituals out of whole cloth without having to know or care anything about any previous Druids.<ref>Personal recollection, Howard Cherniack</ref>  ==Ritual== In accord with the Basic Tenets, Reformed Druid worship is directed toward Nature. Services involve gathering in a wooded place periodically (the original group met weekly during warm weather) and on the festival days of Northern European Pagan tradition.  Services typically include: *The ritual consumption of \"spirits\" ([[Scotch whisky]] blended with water), called \"the Waters-of-Life\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} *The singing of religious songs. *The performance of ceremonial [[chanting]]. *[[Prayer]]s and [[meditation]]s. The written liturgy<ref>[http://orgs.carleton.edu/Druids/ARDA/ARDA-03.pdf RDNA liturgy]</ref> calls for a \"sacrifice of life\".  An early disagreement, recounted in ''The Druid Chronicles'', was resolved by limiting the sacrifice to plant life, whence the term \"Reformed\" was adopted as part of the group's name.<ref>[http://orgs.carleton.edu/druids/ARDA/ARDA-01.pdf The Druid Chronicles]</ref>  According to ancient Druid custom, the officiating Druids, and others who so wish, traditionally wear long white robes, the robe of the Arch-Druid having a distinctive decoration or color. The Waters-of-Life are usually passed to all present as a symbol of the link man has with Nature. Incantation recalling ancient [[Celtic mythology]] is also used. In order to focus attention on Nature, various aspects of it retain the names of corresponding Celtic gods and goddesses. For example:{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} *[[Dalon Ap Landu]] – the grove *[[Grannos]] – healing springs *[[Mars (mythology)#Celtic Mars|Braciaca]] – malt *[[Belenos]] – the sun *[[Sirona]] – rivers *[[Taranis]] – thunder and lightning *[[Llyr]]- the sea *[[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]] – fertility  ==Festivals== Druid festivals correspond to the important dates of the old Celtic year. Celebration begins at sundown the previous evening, and may include [[feasts]], [[bonfires]], and revelry appropriate to the season. The RDNA also adopted the ancient Germanic [[fire days]], or [[solstice]] festivals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Season of Geimredh (Winter) *[[Samhain]] – Oct. 31 *[[Winter Solstice]] – Dec. 21 Season of Earrach (Spring) *[[Oimelc]] – Feb. 2 *[[Spring Equinox]] – Mar. 21 Season of Samradh (Summer) *[[Beltane]] – May 1 *[[Summer Solstice]] – June 21 Season of Foghamhar (Fall) *[[Lugnasadh]] – Aug. 2 *[[Autumn Equinox]] – Sept. 21  (The original group, and ''The Druid Chronicles'', did not include the equinoxes — for which there is little evidence in ancient Northern European tradition — but they are now observed by many Reformed Druids.){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  The phases of the moon are also followed closely, but in practice rarely celebrated in a liturgical manner, except by modern groves with a neopagan focus or women's mysteries. Projects are started on a waxing moon and completed on a waning moon. The night of the full moon is considered a time of rejoicing; while the night of the new moon is a solemn occasion, calling for vigils and meditation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ==Organization== A great majority of the followers of Reformed Druidism are not currently in a group, especially with the advent of information on the internet. There are two types of groups within the RDNA: [[grove (Reformed Druids of North America)|groves]] and [[proto-grove]]s. A grove is a group of Druids who have been established, usually at least three members, and who have a third order Druid as their Arch-Druid. The Carleton grove established the tradition of three officers (though this structure is not mandatory): *Arch-Druid, a third order priest, to direct worship; *Preceptor, a second order Druid, to handle business matters; *Server, a first order Druid to assist the Arch-Druid. A proto-grove is a beginning grove that has no third order Druid; these are typically smaller than a regular grove.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  To become a first order Druid, a person must partake of the Waters-of-Life, and affirm their acceptance of the Basic Tenets. To become a second order Druid, one must pledge themselves to the service of the RDNA, as well as have an understanding of basic Druidism. To become a third order priest, one must dedicate oneself to a life of Druidic inquiry, starting with an all-night, outdoor [[vigil]].  {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  All three of the main orders are bestowed by an ordination script which is inserted within a regular liturgy. The affirmation of the two tenets and partaking of the waters is the script for the first ordination, often followed by tracing the Druid Sigil on their forehead by the Arch Druid.  The second ordination poses a series of questions about the waters-of-life, followed by an ordeal of a large drink of the waters-of-life.  The third ordination normally follows a period of tutelage, a vigil, and a sunrise ceremony in which the ordainer passes on the apostolic succession and assists in the new priest's first consecration of the waters-of-life.  In cases of undue geographic isolation, such ordinations have occurred by telephone or proxy.  Ordinations traditionally occur during the Season of Life, between Beltane and Samhain, emergencies excepted.  Higher orders of the priesthood (up to the tenth) recognize outstanding insight and dedication over a period of time. They are similar to [[academic degree]]s in that they represent recognition of personal achievement, but carry no special authority. Each order of the priesthood is dedicated to one of the eight aspects of [[Nature]].  As of 1967 only the fourth through seventh were completed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ===Council of Dalon Ap Landu=== The Council of Dalon ap Landu is the collective body of all Third Order Druids, chaired by the Arch-Druid of Carleton. In it rests the legislative authority of the movement. From 1964 to 1981, several proposals were considered by the Council, which by tradition has operated by consensus. The last passing resolution, in 1971, unequivocally gave equal status to female and male Druids in the Third Order and higher orders.  ====Priestesses==== Early tradition, as noted in ''The Druid Chronicles'', had originally restricted voting to men, and limited the number of orders a woman could belong to.  The first woman (Dannie Hotz) was ordained to the Third and Fourth Orders in 1965, when Priestesses gained the right o become Arch-Druids, Vigil unto the Third Order, and to officiate services.  This was again clarified by a vote in 1966. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Women incrementally increased their authority and liberty between 1964 and 1970, and women did vote before 1971. The Council of Dalon Ap Landu was led by a woman 1968-1969, since Marta Peck was the first Archdruidess of Carleton. After 3 years of discussion, the 1971 decision was passed unanimously by male voters, acknowledging de facto changes and removing any distinction based on gender.  Women constitute currently about 40% of the historical membership of the priesthood and Archdruidcies.  ====Isaac Affair==== During the [[Isaac Bonewits|Isaac]] Affair of 1974–1977, disagreement over the future of the Reform led to several split votes, which led to schisms, new Councils, and the end of the practical use of the Council of Dalon Ap Landu, due to the rising number of priests, the difficult logistics of voting, and the tradition of consensus. The Council of DAL remains in existence, but is effectively in permanent [[abeyance]], acting both as a rhetorical muse to address in letters, and as a brake on any further organization of the Reform on a national level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ==Purpose== On a superficial level, it might now seem that the purpose of Reformed Druidism is merely to delve into the strange customs and rituals of the ancient Celts, and to have some fun doing it, and also to serve as a new and different type of protest movement. But, on deeper examination of the RDNA, it might be said to have an important purpose: *In communing with Nature, it seeks to promote a spirit of meditation and introspection, aimed ultimately at awareness of religious truth. *It encourages all to seek their own spiritual path through active engagement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ==Branches== In 1966, [[Robert Larson]], an ordained priest of the original Carleton Grove, moved to [[Berkeley, California]], where he and [[Isaac Bonewits]] founded a small Druidic group with connections to various [[wicca]]n covens, and groups which practiced [[ceremonial magic]]. This became known as the Berkeley Grove.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  In the mid-1970s, Bonewits sought to recast the RDNA as a Neo-Pagan organization with substantially more organizational machinery; but this met with resistance from several Druids from the Carleton Grove, which had never identified as Neo-Pagan, and saw no point in the organizational innovations.  Several groves subsequently broke off to form \"Branches\" of Reformed Druidism. From the RDNA, in 1976, a new order formed called the New RDNA (NRDNA), which organized under a Council of Arch-Druids, specifically to have a national body more responsive than the Council of Dalon Ap Landu. Some NRDNA groves wanted to restrict membership to Neo-Pagans, and experiment with changes to ritual and the structure of their groves; these became the Schismatic Druids of North America (SDNA). Groves not participating in these changes or schisms were, by default, considered the RDNA. The definition of \"Reformed Druidism\" stretched to include these variants, not just the RDNA, but the NRDNA, SDNA, and independent folk who just believed in the Basic Tenets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Each of these branches generally followed the same ordination formula for First through Third Orders; members of each branch would enter Higher Orders too. Any Third Order member of any Branch was still a member of the original Council of Dalon Ap Landu; but this Council had already stopped functioning for practical purposes. Other means of interaction between Groves were devised, but they also faded away.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Many members of the SDNA groves left in the 1980s to form the [[Ár nDraíocht Féin]] (ADF), taking a few lessons from Reformed Druidism with them—notably the Waters of Life, an RDNA invention. Currently, in most RDNA and NRDNA groves, members can belong to any or no religion; and due to the emphasis on Grove autonomy, and resulting Grove diversity, there is now little to distinguish between RDNA and NRDNA.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Today Ár nDraíocht Féin has groves present across the [[United States]], in [[Canada]], and in some other countries. There is also another group which was an offshoot from the ADF<ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/druid3.htm Druidic Groups and Information Sources], retrieved 12 February 2011.</ref> and considers its lineage to come from the Reformed Druids, the [[Henge of Keltria]]. They also have various groves and groups around [[North America]].  The most recent branch of the Reform Druids are the Reformed Druids of Gaia (RDG) in November 2006 that was founded by members from a side-order known as the Order of Mithril Star (OMS) which began in 2003.  OMS was inspired by thoughts and practices of the Church of All Worlds and the novel Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein.  Many members of RDG today do not ascribe to the customs of OMS anymore. RDG derives its priestly linneage from Cerridwen in 2006, they have different ordination procedures, study program and ordination rites.  As a result, the branch of the RDG and the branches of RDNA/NRDNA do not officially recognize each other's ordinations, although each forms similar roles, and respectful interaction and collaboration occurs.  The RDG has greater central organization, systemized membership fees, study materials, a separate majority vote law code by the Third Order, and don't observe a season of sleep between Samhain and Beltane.  The RDG's liturgies resemble those of the RDNA & NRDNA, and members often refer to the historical ARDA 2 collection of Reformed Druid materials that continued up to 2005. RDG has over 400 members and 35 priests and 20 groves. Interaction between the RDG and RDNA and NRDNA is very frequent and often cordial with some cross-over membership, although separate social media, websites and newsletters have given them somewhat distinct senses of identity.  ===Diversity=== Until 1983, except for a few fraternal Druid organizations with branches in the USA, Reformed Druidism was really the only publicly known type of neo-druidism in America. ADF provided a training program for Neo-Pagan Druids interested in [[Indo-European]] religious concepts, a strong central church-like structure, a liturgical formula, and a great number of council and rules.  The RDNA has provided a similar niche for laid-back, disorganized, eclectic Druidism with a vague philosophical/religious outlook that closes parallels the niche of the Order of Bards Ovates and Druids (OBOD) in Europe, which was founded in 1964.  Little interaction is believed to have occurred between the RDNA and OBOD before the late 1990s, each isolate evolving in parallel.  Over the years, many aspiring Druids joined ADF, borrowed some ideas and produced dozens of new groups of their own. Henge of Kelria was the largest offshoot, when this group split off for reasons of protest over training programs, charges of ineptitude, and a preference for only [[Celtic paganism|Celtic]] sources of inspiration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Similarly, the Order of Whiteoak borrowed material from ADF, RDNA, and Keltra, but produced primarily a core of material based on their own research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  ==Literature== While Reformed Druids are considered the least organized and most playful Druids, their literature is perhaps the more extensively produced and archived of any modern Druid group in America. It is estimated that it would take 100 full days to read through the 7000 pages of the whole genre. Despite the sheer volume,  it is quite possible and common for prominent members to participate actively in a Grove or a conference for years without having read more than a few dozen pages, as the oral and living traditions are also quite vital and nuanced.  The written traditions were mostly composed by members of the Third Order priesthood, but the writers do not claim divine inspiration.  An understanding or agreement with the written material is generally not required for any office or ordination, but is more commonly browsed by members entering the second or higher orders, or when assuming office responsibilities in a Grove.  The literature is notably non-dogmatic, eclectic, leaning towards philosophic rather than magic in focus, and often written \"tongue-in-cheek\", with authors tending to poke fun at themselves.  Reformed Druidic literature has been an almost entirely open literature, unlike many fraternal or mystical Druid organizations that restrict material to initiates. Most earlier publications were limited in distribution, primarily by the cost of publication in the 1960s and 1970s, but available upon request.  While generally well-researched and crafted, Reformed Druidic materials are not intended as serious academic works, and are intended for its own audience.  Except of a few pamphlets, these materials have not been used for proselytizing.  Despite the Reformed Druids' lack of missionary impulse, many of the literary traits from Reformed Druidism were transferred to later groups that trace their origins to the RDNA. This is due in large part to the influence of Isaac Bonewits' fervent missionary and publishing efforts in newsletters, member guides, seminary materials and popular books from 1971-2010.  The literature of the major works have various distinct genres, including; the writing of epistles, drafting liturgies, collecting materials for meditative use, historiography, calendar and protocol guides, research tracts on modern and ancient Druidry, council records, oral histories, local event chronographies, teaching guides for new members, recruitment materials, terminology references, bardic material collections, and even game design.  In addition to the major printed collections that have grown exponentially larger every decade, several newsletters and magazines have been published, websites and talk groups have held online since the early 1990s. In other media, members of the Reform has produced full-length movies, albums, and an animated series.  Members of the Reformed Druid priesthood (such as Isaac Bonewits and more recently, John Michael Greer) have published short stories, novels, several books on religion, including modern Druidism, even though those works are not directly related to Reformed Druidism.  ===Major Works===  * 1964 The Druid Chronicles (Reformed) * 1976 The Druid Chronicles (Evolved) (first edition) * 1982 Druid Compendium (project aborted when ADF founded) * 1996 A Reformed Druid Anthology  * 2004 The Carleton Druid Collection * 2004 The Druid Chronicles (Evolved), third edition * 2004 A Reformed Druid Anthology 2 (Main Volume) * 2005 A Reformed Druid Anthology 2 (Green Books Volume) * 2005 A Reformed Druid Anthology 2 (Magazines Volume).  * 2009 Unofficial Welcome Pamphlet (first edition) * 2010 The Druid's Path (first edition)  ===Minor Works=== * 1966 Black Book of Liturgy * 1966 Green Book of Meditations (first edition) * 1974 Green Book of Meditations (second edition) * 1994 Orange Book of Apocrypha  ===Newsletters=== * 1977-1981 The Druid Chronicler * 1978-1981 The Pentalpha Journal * 1982-1991 A Druid Missal-Any * 1994 News from the Hill of Three Oaks * 1994 The Standing Stone * 2000-2008 A Druid Missal-Any * 2003-2012 The Druid's Egg * 2008–Present The Druid Inquirer  ===Movies=== * 1995 Gatorr: The Fighting Rabbit * 2011–2012 Desperate Druids, a webseries  ==References== ;Footnotes {{reflist||colwidth=30em}}  ;Bibliography {{refbegin}} * {{cite book |title= Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers and Other Pagans in America ''(revised edition)'' |last= [[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]]   |year= 2006 |publisher= Penguin |location= London |isbn=978-0-14-303819-1 |nopp=|ref=Adl06}} * {{cite book |title= Bonewit's Essential Guide to Druidism |last= [[Isaac Bonewits|Bonewits, Isaac]]   |year= 2006 |publisher= Kensington Publishing Group |location= New York |isbn=0-8065-2710-2 |nopp=|ref=Bon06|pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=Wp6YWCAtGJwC&pg=PA84&dq=Reformed+Druids+of+North+America&hl=en&ei=yIdtTaTMKoH4swPU1ry4BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Reformed%20Druids%20of%20North%20America&f=false 84–106]}} * {{cite book |title= Her Hidden Children: The Rise of Wicca and Paganism in America |last= [[Chas S.

From 1902 to 1974, Scalby was an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]].<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10136374&c_id=10001043]</ref>  Scalby is approximately 3 miles north of Scarborough, and is separated from the town's suburbs by the [[Scalby Beck]], which flows to the North Sea at [[Scalby Mills]]. Scalby is a nuclear village which is bisected by the [[A171 road|A171]] Scarborough to Whitby road. The older part of the village is west of the main crossroads and is focussed around a small but busy High Street. There are two pubs, a newsagent (replaced by a beauty salon in October 2013), village store, two restaurants and a local hair salon. In addition there is Scalby [[Methodism|Methodist]] Chapel and the Church Rooms. [[File:Scalby Beck and the Old Scalby Mills.jpg|thumb|left|Scalby Beck and the Old Scalby Mills]]  In modern times, as an artificial flood relief channel, much of the flow of the [[River Derwent, Yorkshire|River Derwent]] (which drains a large area of the [[North York Moors]] into the [[Vale of Pickering]]) has been diverted, (about {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} upstream of [[West Ayton]] and before it reaches the plain of the Vale of Pickering), into a new channel called the Sea Cut which runs east along a previously dry side valley (probably a [[glacial overflow channel]]) and into the existing [[Scalby Beck]].  The [[parish church]] of Scalby is St Laurence's. The church is the oldest recorded building in the village. Records show its presentation in 1150 by Eustace Fitz John. The chancel arch and pillars are of that time and the first recorded priest, inducted in 1238, was Henry Devon. It is designated a Grade II* listed building.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1148211|desc=Church of St Laurence|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>  Scalby belongs to the ward of Scalby, [[Hackness]] and [[Staintondale]], which the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] records as having a population of 3,953 over an expanse of 10,186 hectares.  The village is well served by sports facilities. Scalby Tennis Club is located to the east of the junction of the A171 and Station Road. The club has two floodlit courts and further use of two public courts adjacent to the private courts. Additionally there is the Scalby & Newby Lawn Bowling club which shares the site and the clubhouse. On a small hill behind the western limits of the village is the location of Scalby Cricket Club (Carr Lane playing fields which are held in trust by the Parish Council). During the winter months this doubles as a football pitch.  In January 2009, Scarborough Rugby club moved from their old grounds in Newby to a new purpose-built club on the northern edge of Scalby, adjacent to the [[A171 road|A171]].  The village has a number of [[Bed and breakfast|B&B]]s and holiday cottages along with the prominent Wrea Head Country Hotel, built in 1881.  Scalby has been twinned with the village of [[Pornic]] in north-west France, since 1989  ==References== {{Reflist}}  == External links == {{Commons category|Scalby, North Yorkshire}} *[http://flickr.com/photos/yorkshirecoast/sets/72157601345096392/ Internal pictures of St. Laurence's Church] *[http://www.scalbyschool.org.uk Scalby School]  {{Duchy of Lancaster}}  [[Category:Villages in North Yorkshire]]</td></tr><tr><td>Val-Dieu Abbey</td><td>3547454</td><td>660979758</td><td>2015-05-05T17:52:51.000+0000</td><td>P199</td><td>897376</td><td>[[Image:Val Dieu JPG02.jpg|thumb|The abbey church]] [[Image:Val Dieu JPG01.jpg|thumb|Val-Dieu Abbey]] '''Val-Dieu Abbey''' is a former [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] [[monastery]] in the [[Berwinne]] valley near [[Aubel]] in the [[Land of Herve]] ([[Liège (province)|province of Liège]], [[Belgium]]).  ==History== In 1216 a small number of [[monk]]s from the [[Hocht]] part of Lanaken, near [[Maastricht]], settled in the uninhabited valley which formed the border between the [[Duchy of Limburg]] and the county of [[Dalhem]]; they called their settlement ''Vallis Dei'' ({{lang-fr|Val-Dieu}}; {{lang-en|Valley of God}}).  The abbey's original church was destroyed in 1287 during the [[War of the Limburg Succession]]. The church was rebuilt, but was destroyed again in 1574 during the [[Eighty Years' War]], and in 1683 by the armies of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Under the jurisdiction of Abbot Jean Dubois, from 1711 until 1749, the abbey flourished. It was dissolved during the [[French Revolution]], when the church was destroyed for the fourth time.  The remaining buildings were left empty until 1844, when they were resettled by the last living monk of Val-Dieu from the time before the Revolution, together with four monks from [[Bornem Abbey]].  The abbey was closed again in 2001, when the last three monks left. Since 1 January 2002 a small [[Laity|lay]] community has lived there, under the leadership of [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] Jean-Pierre Schenkelaars, overseen by the regional ecclesiastical authorities, in association with the [[Cistercian]] Order.  ==Brewery== In 1997 the [[Brasserie de l'Abbaye du Val-Dieu]] was established in the abbey farm, and brews a range of [[abbey beer|abbey beers]] in the tradition of the former Val-Dieu monks. Their range includes a Belgian blonde (6%), brune (8%), triple (9%), as well as a grand cru (10.5%).  ==Sources== *[http://www.val-dieu.com/ Val-Dieu brewery] *[[De Tijd]], ''Vallei van kaas en siroop'', 24 December 2005  {{Commons category|{{#property:P373}}}} {{coord|50.69792|N|5.805|E|source:dewiki_region:BE-WLG_type:landmark|format=dms|display=title}}  [[Category:Cistercian monasteries in Belgium]] [[Category:1216 establishments]] [[Category:Religious organizations established in the 1210s]] [[Category:Basilica churches in Belgium]] [[Category:Christian monasteries established in the 13th century]] [[Category:Buildings and structures in Liège (province)]]   {{Belgium-Christian-monastery-stub}}</td></tr><tr><td>Neverending White Lights</td><td>3959881</td><td>662841213</td><td>2015-05-17T23:03:33.000+0000</td><td>KasparBot</td><td>24420788</td><td>{{Refimprove|date=August 2012}} {{Infobox musical artist | name = Neverending White Lights | image =  | caption = Daniel Victor promo photo | image_size = 250 | background = group_or_band | origin = [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]] | genre = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[pop rock]], [[indie rock|indie]] | years_active = 2005–present | label = [[Maple Music Recordings]], [[Ocean Records]] | url=[http://www.neverendingwhitelights.com/ www.neverendingwhitelights.com] | current_members = [[Daniel Victor]]<br />Assorted artists }}  '''Neverending White Lights''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] music collaboration project fronted by [[Daniel Victor]] from [[Windsor, Ontario]], and featuring several artists mainly from Canada and the [[United States]]. Daniel Victor performs all musical instruments, with most of his songs featuring guest singers. The idea behind Neverending White Lights is to present a sampling of different voices, styles, and artists, while retaining the 'focused' sound characteristic of a band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/neverending-white-lights/228/|title=Neverending's story, chapter II|accessdate=November 2007}}</ref>  ==History==  ===Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies===  At the age of nineteen, Victor began to drift apart from working in the 'band-like' environments from his adolescence and experiment with multi-tracking himself in the studio.  These early recordings eventually became the first batch of songs from his debut release, [[Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies|''Act I: Goodbye Friends Of The Heavenly Bodies'']].  Though proficient enough on most instruments, Victor felt that utilizing the same singer on every song could grow tired, and was all too common. The idea of movie soundtracks, compilations, and frequent collaborations on Hip-Hop records intrigued him, and he wanted to bring these ideas over to the indie-alt music world and create an entirely different sort of album: something he didn't have in his collection, but wanted to have. After making notes of all his favourite singers, he began sending compositions to the various vocalists he felt would be a good fit for the songs.  His idea was to create something more interesting than just another album by another band, something that offered a bigger experience for the listener.  He was finding himself more influenced by textural sounds, cinematic production and melancholy songwriting.  These were the basic attributes he tended to create given complete free rein on the music and production. He created worlds of ambience, melody, and emotion within each composition.  'Vibe' was very important to him.  It wasn't just about 'songs', but about environments; how and where they live.  He listed a wide range of influences, including:  [[Brian Eno]], [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Radiohead]], [[Sigur Ros]], Kent, and [[Massive Attack]]; though it's impossible to cite the amount of music Victor digested on a weekly basis that would serve as a foundation for NWL's sound.  For Victor, it was very important to have melody and atmosphere.  After Victor finished school, he spent all his time devoted to making the record he envisioned.  The name \"Neverending White Lights\" came to him one night after flipping through his old notebooks in search of key words.  The lyric stood out to him and gave him the sense of infinity and foreverness he was trying to create with the project.  It was also a metaphor for humans; he explains: \"There is an energy in people that doesn't go away when they die.  While the physical body stays on earth, the light escapes.  That is what we're made of, that never-ending light\".  With the premiss of the album's content starting to unfold, Victor deemed it important to make the album a concept record; an entire collection of sixteen songs all telling one story, in different ways.  This would be an ongoing story, from album to album, each with a different conceptual basis for the lyrics.  The albums would be the \"Acts\", and the songs would be the \"Scenes\", and of course, the various singers would become the \"Actors\" - much like a movie or stage play.  It was an ambitious undertaking for one person to put together with no help in the industry and no band to provide feedback, and this difficulty led him into some troubled territories.  His first actual collaboration for this album was a song called \"On Fire\" which he wrote alongside Switchfoot frontman Jon Foreman in San Diego California in 2001. The song did not end up on Victor's first record.  Instead, it was recorded for Switchfoot's Columbia Records release ''The Beautiful Letdown'', which went on to sell over 3 million copies.  After a very trying experience realizing this overly ambitious debut, Victor surfaced with the finished album in September 2005. It featured over a dozen guest vocalists, many of which were Victor's favourite artists.  He states: \"It means more to me to hold a burned copy of this finished concept in my hands after seeing it in my head for so long, than it does to actually release it to the world.  I'd rather just put it on my shelf to listen to now and then and reflect on what it means to have completed this personal musical ambition.\"  Act 1: Goodbye Friends Of The Heavenly Bodies features lead members of: 311, [[City & Colour]], [[Finger Eleven]], Our Lady Peace, Ours, Hum (band), Shudder to Think, The Velvet Teen, Age of Electric, The Watchmen, The Black Maria, Creeper Lagoon, Starflyer 59, Deckard, Supergarage, Evelynn, and Cirrus.  Though a completely unknown producer, the originality and creativity in the concept and music solidified their commitment to the project.  Victor wrote nearly all the music, produced, and performed all the instrumentation himself.  It's important to note that Victor insists on performing all the instruments on his albums himself.  This one-man operation from the writing process to the end product is the key element to the unique sound of Neverending White Lights.  There were several unreleased tracks written and recorded from Act 1 which have not yet been released.  These include the songs: \"John Dies At 56 ft. Mogwai\", \"Throwing Chairs ft. [[Switchfoot]]\", \"Shipbuilding ft. Unbelievable Truth\" ([[Thom Yorke]]'s brother), and \"This Is My Fate ft. [[City & Colour]]\".  On September 27, 2005, the album was released independently through Ocean Records Canada (Victor's own record label).  The first single, \"The Grace,\" which featured Canadian singer [[Dallas Green (musician)|Dallas Green]], was very well received;  finishing as the 6th most spun song on Canadian Rock Radio in 2006.  The music video eventually hit #1 on Much Music and Much More Music.  The album sold close to 40K copies in Canada, and garnered a number of awards and nominations, including a Juno nomination for Best New Artist.  A spring tour supporting Canadian legends Our Lady Peace soon followed.  The album was also met with vast critical acclaim across the country which quickly jump-started Victor's career as a writer, producer and entity.  This was also re-enforced by three music videos released as a trilogy for the album, all telling one long story through the vision of Director RT!  ===Act 2: The Blood and the Life Eternal===  After gaining a following in Canada, Victor had to come to terms with the expectations to out-do himself and make a stronger second album. Now that he had people's attention, this was his chance to really focus on showcasing who he is and what he's capable of delivering. There was an immediate pressure to write another 'hit' single and to work with the right singers in order to not tarnish the path he was paving. Instead of wallowing in self-doubt on his direction and material, Victor used the pressure to fuel himself creatively. He researched various concepts of interest to write about, initially choosing 'ghosts and spirits' only to find himself being the subject of hauntings and strange occurrences. He brainstormed further ideas and eventually decided to focus on the concept of 'Everlasting Life' - something that could serve as an extension of the previous album, but create something much different. The lyrics he wrote reflected themes such as vampire love stories and bloodlust (The Living / Black Is The Colour Of My True Love's Heart / Bleeds To An End), suicide/seeking shelter in the spirit world (Dove Coloured Sky / The World is Darker), and other variations on this topic. 'Blood' was a common image through the lyrics and artwork, representing life in its simplest form, and something strong, sexual, and powerful.  The album was recorded in Daniel's basement studio during the course of 2006/2007. Victor produced and mixed the album, performed the instruments, as well as obtained a new cast of vocalists. The content was influenced in part by the reverb-heavy 80's music of his youth, draped in haze and serving up big choruses for the ears; these nostalgic elements seeped their way into the production, citing artists like Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, and George Michael as influences. Act II didn't try to emulate their sound, so much as draw on the memories of the material as a playground for creativity.  On October 30, 2007, Victor emerged with this second release entitled: [[Act 2: The Blood and the Life Eternal|''Act II: The Blood And The Life Eternal'']]. The album featured members of the following groups: [[Aqualung (musician)|Aqualung]], [[The Raveonettes]], Mobile, [[Catherine Wheel]], [[Auf der Maur]], Hawksley Workman, Magneta Lane, Mellowdrone, and Ours. The lead single entitled \"Always\", was the first track to feature Victor himself on vocals and peaked at # 18 on the Canadian top 40 Rock Chart. It's uptempo driving sound marked a notable change in direction from the very slow tempos of the previous album and single. The video was influenced by movies such as 'Vanilla Sky' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' in the way in which it melded nostalgic memories together to tell a story. He later followed with a second single \"The World is Darker\" Ft. Melissa Auf der Maur (Smashing Pumpkins/Hole) which was the first video to feature the actual vocalist in it. The third and final single was \"Where We Are Ft. Rob Dickinson\".  The album was met with much praise and critical acclaim including and many 5 star reviews. Fans of the group gravitated towards NWL's progression of sound, story, and image, and Victor further solidified the project's identity.  In 2008, Victor took time off and decided not to tour the album. He spent time adjusting to his career and spending time with loved ones; something he had no time to do between the first two albums. It was also important to him creatively that he find a new place of inspiration and energy before writing another album from scratch. During this time he produced and recorded something entirely different to change his writing style. This project was called ''Black Ribbons'' and is a 12-song electro-pop-noir album that he produced and recorded in a few short months. He wrote every song on the bass guitar, which gave the project a different perspective of songwriting.  ===Act III: Love Will Ruin (2009-present)===  In 2009, Victor went to work on writing new material for Act 3. This time he knew exactly what he wanted to focus his concept on: Tragic Love. Love itself was a topic he had mostly stayed away from due to its commonplace in music, but he wanted to focus on a certain aspect of it - the longing, heartache, and sadness of it - and how there is beauty to be found there. Between mounting pressures to produce radio singles and to repeat past successes, yet to still maintain true to the artistic integrity NWL was founded on, writing and production was staggered and troublesome. Victor eventually went on to write and record nearly seventy songs for inclusion on this album, only to throw them away after spending much time and money to complete them. It wasn't until he had a 'finished' copy in his hands after two years of painstaking work and travel that he decided it was unworthy to be released as an NWL album, and threw it in the trash.  He started over from scratch and found inspiration deep within himself, instead of from outside influence and pressure. It was this personal freedom and revelation that allowed the proper album to surface. Victor stated that \"every song has to take you somewhere, every song has to hit you, and every song has to make you close your eyes and get chills. It was the letting go that allowed me to get to those moments. I tested them on myself, and these are the songs that have stood up for me.\" This batch of music became Act 3.  On September 21, 2010, Daniel leaked the first song from ''Act 3: Love Will Ruin'' entitled \"The Lonely War\", which features Evan Konrad of the band '[[Bed of Stars]]'. He also stated that due to difficulties with a rupture in his vocal cords, the official release date of the album was delayed from 2009 to late 2011.  In spring 2011, the first single/video from \"Act 3\" was released entitled \"Falling Apart Ft. Bed of Stars\". In October, the single \"Ghost Ship Ft. Hot Hot Heat\" was released, eventually peaking at #9 for 3 weeks on ALT Rock in Canada.  The album Act III: Love Will Ruin was finally released on November 18, 2011 to general critical praise. It features guest performances by Hot Hot Heat, Bed of Stars, and Pilot Speed. The album focuses more on Victor's own vocal performances and is generally more uptempo and rock than the previous releases. This change in style was a result of performing material live on stage over the years and finding the music taking on more of an edge. This increase in energy was also brought forward in an attempt to begin shifting NWL's sound to something more driving than downtempo and slow. This noticeable result can be heard on tracks such as \"Starlight\", \"The Lonely War\", and Falling Apart. Although the songs go over better in a live setting, many fans of the project's original style have criticized the change.  Victor is currently working on the 4th studio album in the Neverending White Lights series that will most likely be named \"Act IV\" in a follow up to \"Act III\". As of October 29th, 2014, it is currently slated for a late spring 2015 release. There is not yet any official word as to whom Victor will be collaborating with but it has been speculated that [[Deftones]]/[[Crosses (band)|Crosses]] frontman [[Chino Moreno]], singer/songwriter [[Active Child]], [[The Tea Party]], and [[Mother Mother]] might appear on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neverendingwhitelights.com/news/|title=Neverending White Light's site, news post from October 29, 2014|accessdate=November 2014}}</ref>  ==Discography==  === Albums === *2005: ''[[Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies]]'' *2007: ''[[Act 2: The Blood and the Life Eternal]]'' *2011: ''Act 3: Love Will Ruin''<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMVXJgrH5h0 Daniel Victor Exclusive Interview on 3rd Album].

The dancers, standing in several rows, may be further choreographed to execute different figures (including box, figure 8, circles, and half circles) while maintaining the hip-shaking. The hip motion itself may in some choreographies be synchronized amongst multiple dancers and may be further coordinated with the accompanying percussion arrangement.  The dance is with music only (drums) at a fast rhythm, and no singing. The drum can be one of the different types of the ''tō{{okina}}ere'', a lying log of wood with a longitudinal slit, which is struck by one or two sticks. Additional drum types accompanying the dance may include the ''pahu'' (the ancient Tahitian, standing drum covered with a shark skin and struck by the hands or with sticks) played at a slower rhythm, or the smaller ''fa{{okina}}atētē'' drum.  The {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a is one of the few dances which already existed in pre-European times as a male dance. (The ''hura'' (Tahitian vernacular for [[hula]]), a dance for women, on the other hand has disappeared, and likewise is gone the couple's dance [['upa'upa|{{okina}}upa{{okina}}upa]] but which may have reemerged as the [[tamure|tāmūrē]]). Nowadays, however the {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a can be danced by men ({{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a tāne), by women ({{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a vahine), or by both genders ({{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a {{okina}}āmui = united {{okina}}ō.).  Dancers of the {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a make gestures reenacting daily occupations of life. For the men the gestural themes can be chosen from warfare or sailing, and then they may use spears or paddles. For women the gestural themes are typically closer to home or from nature: hand gestures suggesting combing their hair, or the flight of a butterfly. More elaborate themes have been adopted; for example one where the dancers end up in a map of Tahiti, highlighting important places. In a proper {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a the story of the theme should pervade the whole dance.  The costumes are extremely elaborate, typically incorporating long plant fiber (\"grass\") skirts, belting with tassels that accentuate the hip-motion, may further include decorated headpieces, and may be color-coordinated across the dancers of the company.  The same ''more'' dress and the same shaking of the knees for the boys and those of the hips for the girls as in all Tahitian dances (see [[tamure|tāmūrē]]) is used here too.  The {{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a is considered as Tahiti's best and most spectacular dance, maybe even of whole Polynesia.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  ==Modern and Adoptive Interpretation==  Interpretations of the '''{{okina}}ōte{{okina}}a''' are frequently included as part of larger Polynesian dance recitals presented at luaus and visitor-oriented live shows in the Hawaiian Islands and other Pacific-rim resorts outside Tahiti.  Modern interpretations include costumes fashioned of contemporary man-made materials (polyester films such as mylar, or synthetic twines) substituting for plant-fiber or natural materials, and costume coloration such as fluorescent pinks and greens or mirror-reflective surfaces difficult to obtain or maintain from purely natural resources.  Modern drum accompaniments may include drums of European- or non-Pacific construction, improvised percussion instruments of modern materials (e.g. high-density polyethylene or metallic commercial food packaging), and the use of prerecorded drum reinforcement soundtracks.  Contemporary performances of the dance range in length from less than a minute to as long as five or six minutes, with company sizes as few as one dancer to several dozen of single or mixed sex at once.  ==References== *Patrick O'Reilly; ''La danse à Tahiti''.  {{Culture of Oceania}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Otea}} [[Category:Dances of Tahiti]]</td></tr><tr><td>Göteborg City Museum</td><td>4299833</td><td>677796956</td><td>2015-08-25T15:45:29.000+0000</td><td>Johnpacklambert</td><td>2308770</td><td>[[Image:Ostindiska huset september 2010b.jpg|thumb|350px|The City Museum of Göteborg (Gothenburg).]] The '''Göteborg City Museum''' ({{lang-sv|Göteborgs stadsmuseum}}) is in the city centre of [[Gothenburg]], western [[Sweden]].

He is recognized for his [[Surrealism|surreal]] digital photographs that have appeared on album packaging for recording artists, book jackets, and ad campaigns. Obermeyer practices a style of digital photography by collaging and \"painting\" parts of many of his photographs into one seamless amalgam. Obermeyer digitally cuts and manipulates even single strands of hair or folds in fabric. This process leads to a classification of his work between photography and digital illustration. He draws freely from many influences including classic [[children's literature]], [[mythology]], biological processes, aquatic life, music, and film.  ==Biography==  Obermeyer was briefly mentored by a painter at the age of 14 in Dallas. He attended college for a year in Texas before relocating to New York City for a graphic design internship in 1999. Despite the absence of formal training, Obermeyer rose from office intern to contributor, single-handedly undertaking major illustration projects for clients that included [[The Juilliard School]] and The Glaucoma Foundation.  Obermeyer left the internship after a year and established the graphic design firm ON Company with partner Eric Neuner. Obermeyer was responsible for designing and executing illustrations, imagery, and photographs for their design pieces. They achieved commercial success and received critical acclaim from the ''[[New York Times]]'' for \"excellence in design\" for their work with World Monuments Fund.<ref>Louie, Elain (October 12, 2000). \"Russia Struggles to Save Landmarks\". The New York Times</ref> Despite the accolades, he remained devoted to his artistic works. Many of ON Company's clients were directly affected by the unfortunate events of September 11 and the firm was forced to disband in 2002. Obermeyer returned to Texas to focus on his personal artistic endeavors.  ==Career==  [[Image:Lost & Found Ryan Obermeyer.jpg|thumb|left|Lost & Found - Created for recording artists [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]], 2001]]  While still living in Manhattan, Obermeyer attended a concert featuring the cello rock band [[Rasputina (band)|Rasputina]]. A friendship with the singer [[Melora Creager]], founded on aesthetic similarities, was forged. Obermeyer created his first commissioned digital piece, ''Lost & Found'', for the imminent Rasputina CD release of the same name (2001). He was the youngest artist to be included at the 44th Annual [[Society of Illustrators]] Exhibition in New York with this piece. Obermeyer has since created numerous pieces for the band and has accompanied them on several unconventional American tours, selling books of his art while contributing backup vocals from the merchandise area. He conceived artwork for several of their subsequent releases including ''[[Cabin Fever (Rasputina album)|Cabin Fever]]'' (2002), ''[[My Fever Broke]]'' (2002), and ''[[Frustration Plantation]]'' (2004).

However, in 793 Trisong Detsen resolved that Moheyan did not hold the true [[Dharma]]. Following intense protests from Moheyan’s supporters, Trisong Detsen proposed to settle the matter by sponsoring a debate.{{refn|group=note|[[Dialectic]] is an ancient aspect of the [[Indian religions|Indian]] and [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]], as it is in [[Himalaya]]n tradition.}} The most famous of these debates has become known as the \"Council of Lhasa\", although it may have taken place at Samye, a considerable distance from [[Lhasa]]. For the famed Council of Lhasa, an Indian monk named [[Kamalashila|Kamalaśila]] was invited to represent [[Indian Buddhism]], while Moheyan represented [[Northern School]] [[Chán]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]].  While Moheyan took a [[Subitism|subitist]] approach to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], his position was weakened when conceding that practices such as the [[Pāramitā|perfection of morality]], studying the sutras and teachings of the masters, and cultivating meritorious actions were appropriate. These types of actions were seen as part of the \"gradualist\" school, and Moheyan held that these were only necessary for those of \"dim\" facility and \"dull\" propensity. Those of \"sharp\" and \"keen\" facility and propensity do not need these practices, as they have \"direct\" access to the truth through meditation. This concession to the \"gradualists\", that not everyone can achieve the highest state of meditation, left Moheyan open to the charge that he had a dualistic approach to practice. To overcome these inconsistencies in his thesis, Moheyan claimed that when one gave up all conceptions, an automatic, all-at-once attainment of virtue resulted. He taught that there was an \"internal\" practice to gain [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] and liberate one-self, and an \"external\" practice to liberate others ([[upaya]], or skillful means). These were seen as two independent practices, a concession to human psychology and scriptural tradition.  Most Tibetan sources state that the debate was decided in Kamasila’s favour (though many Chinese sources claim Moheyan won){{sfn|Powers|2004|p=38-44}} and Moheyan was required to leave the country and that all sudden-enlightenment texts were gathered and destroyed by royal decree. This was a pivotal event in the history of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which would afterward continue to follow the late Indian model with only minor influence from [[China]].  Nevertheless, Chan texts were produced until the 10th century in Tibet, which casts doubt on these Tibetan sources.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik TCI\" />  ==Teachings==  ===Sudden teachings=== {{Main|East Mountain Teachings|Chan Buddhism|Subitism}}  Moheyan’s teachings were a mixture of the East Mountain Teachings{{sfn|Broughton|1983|p=9}}{{refn|group=note|Chinese: 東山法門 ''tung-shan fa-men''; given the appellation of \"Northern School\" Chan by Shenhui (670-762)}} associated with [[Shenxiu]] and [[Baotang]] Chán.{{sfn|Hanson-Barber|1985}} Broughton gives the following nomenclatura:{{sfn|Broughton|1983|p=9}} {{quote|Mo-ho-yen's teaching in Tibet as the famed proponent of the all-at-once gate can be summarized as \"gazing-at-mind\" (k'an-hsin... <nowiki>=</nowiki> sems la bltas{{refn|group=note|IOL Tib J 468: (1v) //bsam gtan nyId du ‘jug pa’I tshe/ bdag gI sems la bltas na/ cI yang sems dpa’ myed de myI bsam mo/ rtog pa’I sems g.yos na tshor bar bya/ cI ltar tshor bar bya zhe na/ gang g.yos pa’I sems de nyId/ g.yos pa dang ma g.yos par yang myI brtag/ yod pa dang myed par yang (2r) myI brtag/ dge ba dang myI dge bar yang myI brtag/ nyong mongs pa dang rnam par byang bar yang myI brtag/ ste// chos thams cad cI lta bur yang myI brtag go// sems g.yos pa de lta bur tshor na rang bzhin myed pa yIn te/ /de nI chos lam spyod pa zhes bya’//<ref group=web>[http://earlytibet.com/2008/05/15/tibetan-chan-ii-the-teachings-of-heshang-moheyan/ Sam van Schaik (2008), ''''Tibetan Chan II: the teachings of Heshang Moheyan''] (accessed: Saturday April 17, 2010)</ref>}} and \"no examining\" (pu-kuan... <nowiki>=</nowiki> myi rtog pa) or \"no-thought no-examining\" (pu-ssu pu-kuan... <nowiki>=</nowiki> myi bsam myi rtog). \"Gazing-at-mind\" is an original Northern (or East Mountain Dharma Gate) teaching. As will become clear, Poa-t'ang and the Northern Ch'an dovetail in the Tibetan sources. Mo-ho-yen's teaching seems typical of late Northern Ch'an. It should be noted that Mo-ho-yen arrived on the central Tibetan scene somewhat late in comparison to the Ch'an transmissions from Szechwan.{{sfn|Broughton|1983|p=9}}}}  The dichotomy of the gradual north and sudden south is a historical construction, as both Northern and Southern Schools contained \"gradualist teachings\"{{refn|group=note|Chinese: ''tun-men''}} and \"sudden teachings\"{{refn|group=note|Chinese: ''chien-men''}} and practices.  ===Liberation from ''vikalpa-citta''=== Gōmez gives a detailed account of the doctrinary differences that were at stake at the \"council of Lhasa\", based on Bu-ston's ''Chos-'yun'', which in turn may have been based on Kamasilá's ''Third [[Bhāvanākrama]]''.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}} Bu-ston had chosen two points to summarize the conflict, which entails complex doxtrinal and historical issues.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}}  Most of what is known of Moheyan’s teaching comes from fragments of writings in Chinese and Tibetan found in the [[Mogao caves]] at [[Dunhuang]], [[Gansu]], [[China]]. The manuscript given the appellation ''IOL Tib J 709'' is a collection of nine Chan texts, commencing with the teachings of Moheyan.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik TCI\" />  According to Bu-ston, the conflict centered around two theses set out by Moheyan:{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}} # \"As long as one carries out good or evil acts, one is not free from transmigration.\"{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=70}} # \"Whoever does not think of anything, whoever does not reflect, will be totally free from transmigration. Not thinking, not pondering, non-examination, non-apprehension of an object - this is the immediate access [to liberation].\"{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=71}}  yet, a principal point of Moheyan's teaching is that according to Moheyan, the root cause of samsara is the creation of false distinctions, ''vikalpa-citta''.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=74}} As long as these false distinctions are being created, one is bound to samsara.  ====Good and evil acts==== According to Bu-ston, Moheyan taught that carrying out good or evil acts binds one to transmigration.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=71}} Moheyan's point is that the concept of good or false is itself still conceptual thinking, which obscures enlightenment. If all thought, good or bad, obscures enlightenment, then all actions must be based on the simplest principles of conduct. To achieve proper conduct, all conceptions, without exception should be seen as false:  {{quote|If one sees conceptions as no conception, one sees the [[Tathāgata]].{{sfn|Gomez|1983|p=90}}}}  ====Not-thinking==== Sam van Schaik notes that Moheyan \"didn’t advocate the suppression of thoughts,\" but rather advised, in his own words: {{quote|[Y]ou should not suppress concepts. Whenever they arise, if you do not fabricate anything but instead let them go, then they will stay as they are and come to rest by themselves; thus you will not pursue them.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik TCIII\">[http://earlytibet.com/2008/06/10/tibetan-chan-iii-more-teachings-of-heshang-moheyan/ Sam van schaik (2008), ''Tibetan Chan III: more teachings of Heshang Moheyan'']</ref>}}  By practicing ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'', awareness should be reverted toward this awareness itself: {{quote|To turn the light [of the mind] towards the mind’s source, that is contemplating the mind [...] one does not reflect on or observe whether thoughts are in movement or not, whether they are pure or not, whether they are empty or not.{{sfn|Gomez|1983|p=93}}}}  By turning the attention inward, one discovers that no \"self-nature\" can be found in the movements of the mind.{{sfn|Gōmez|1983|p=74-75}} Eventually, dhyana leads to the realisation that awareness is [[Sunyata|empty]], and cannot be grasped by concepts: {{quote|When he enters a state of deep contemplation, he looks into his own mind. There being no-mind, he does not engage in thought. If thoughts of discrimination arise, he should become aware of them [...] Whatever thoughts arise, one does not examine [...] He does not examine any dharma whatsoever. If he becomes aware in this way of the arising (of thoughts, he perceives) the absence of self-existence [...] After sitting (in this manner) for a long time, the mind will become tame, and one will realize that his awareness is also discriminating mind [...] Awareness itself is without name or form [...] [T]he awareness and place where it occurs cannot be obtained by any search.

She is a three-time Olympic gold medallist, winning the 500 metres in 1980, the 1000 metres in 1984 and the 1500 metres in 1984. She won a total of eight Olympic medals.   ==Short biography== Karin Enke started her sport career as a figure skater at the club SC Einheit [[Dresden]]. Representing East Germany she came in ninth place at the [[European Figure Skating Championships]] in 1977. Later she changed to speed skating. Dominant on all distances (being reigning [[World Allround Speed Skating Championships|World Allround Champion]] and [[World Sprint Speed Skating Championships|World Sprint Champion]], and having won German Single Distance Championships titles on all five distances in 1983), Enke was the favourite for all four distances at the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] of [[Sarajevo]], but she won \"only\" two gold and two silver medals.<ref name=r1/> At the [[Speed Skating World Cup|World Cup]], Enke had 21 single-distance victories, but won only one overall World Cup. She retired from speed skating after the 1987–88 season.  Born as ''Karin Enke'', she married in 1981 and competed as ''Karin Busch'' during the 1981–82 winter. The marriage did not last long and during the 1982–83 and 1983–84 winters, she competed as ''Karin Enke'' again. After marrying her longtime former trainer Rudolf Kania in 1984, she competed as ''Karin Kania'' for the rest of her speed skating career. After her career had ended, she divorced and married again and became ''Karin Enke-Richter''.  Like several other female East German skaters who got married after the season had ended (and several of them more than once over the course of their careers), Enke caused some confusion among the speed skating public when she&mdash;a skater with a name unfamiliar to them&mdash;suddenly won major titles in her \"first\" season. Commentators were apt to make remarks like \"Karin Kania is the skater we knew as Karin Enke last season\" and some commentators even, half-jokingly, made remarks like \"I wonder what her name will be next season\". To alleviate the confusion, Enke kept her [[maiden name]] as the ''first'' part of her last name after her third marriage, just like [[Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann|Gunda Kleemann]] (also known as ''Gunda Niemann'' and ''Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann'') kept ''Niemann'' (the name of her first husband) as the ''first'' part of her last name even after her divorce and both before and after her second marriage, which is unusual in most Western European countries.  ==Doping use== On 3 January 2010, Giselher Spitzer, a German sport historian and researcher of the Humboldt University in Berlin, claimed in the Dutch TV documentary ''Andere Tijden'' ('Other Times') that back in 1984, Karin Enke had been prepared with doping.

''Willmarth'' was laid down on 25 June 1943 at [[San Francisco, California]], by the [[Bethlehem Steel Company]]'s Shipbuilding Division; launched on 21 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Eva Willmarth, the mother of Ens. Willmarth; and commissioned on 13 March 1944, Lieutenant Commander James G. Thorburn, Jr., [[United States Naval Reserve|USNR]], in command.  ==Service history== ===To the Solomon Islands === Following shakedown out of [[San Diego]] and post-shakedown availability at her builder's yard, ''Willmarth'' was assigned to [[Escort Division 40]]. She stood out of [[San Francisco Bay]] on 31 May, as screen for the four-ship Convoy 2410 bound for [[Hawaii]], and arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] on 9 June.  On 12 June, together with {{USS|Donaldson|DE-44|3}} and {{USS|Reynolds|DE-42|3}}, ''Willmarth'' screened the sortie of the [[Marshall Islands]]-bound Convoy 4212-A. After delivering the [[convoy]] safely at [[Eniwetok]] nine days later, ''Willmarth'' proceeded on to the [[Treasury Islands]], anchoring in [[Blanche Harbor]] at 11:30 on the 26th.  Shifting successively to [[Tulagi]] and [[Purvis Bay]], ''Willmarth'' operated on local escort and patrol missions in the [[Solomon Islands|Solomon]] and [[Treasury Islands]] groups for the remainder of July. She escorted a small convoy to [[Dreger Harbor]], [[New Guinea]], between 1 and 5 August and then shifted to [[Milne Bay]] for repairs on her port propeller.  ===Challenging an unknown ship === Underway for the Treasury Islands on 24 August, ''Willmarth'' made radar contact with an unidentified ship at 02:00 on the 25th. ''Willmarth'' tracked the stranger and challenged her at 03:35, when about two miles (3&nbsp;km) distant. The latter did not reply, but instead altered course away from the destroyer escort and increased speed. ''Willmarth'' in turn churned up {{convert|18|kn|km/h}} and went to general quarters at 03:40.  ''Willmarth'' repeated the challenge at 04:06 but again received no reply. On the port beam of her target, the escort vessel illuminated the stranger with her searchlight and discovered her to be a freighter of some 8,000 to 10,000 tons. Only {{convert|2500|yd}} away, ''Willmarth's'' men could see the freighter's crew manning their guns to challenge the destroyer escort.  ''Willmarth'' opened the range to {{convert|4000|yd}} as the freighter responded with two different call signs, perhaps seeking to confuse the escort vessel. Just as ''Willmarth'' began to flash a call for recognition signals, the freighter commenced fire with {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} guns. The destroyer escort rang down for {{convert|20|kn|km/h}} and opened the range to {{convert|8000|yd}}, refraining from firing because of the stranger's appearance and location, \"indicating that it was friendly.\" With respect to the freighter's fierce — but fortunately ineffective — fire, ''Willmarth's'' war diarist noted charitably that the ship's \"range was excellent, but deflection was off.\" No shells landed closer than {{convert|1000|yd}} away.  ===Escort ship=== ''Willmarth'' subsequently anchored at Blanche Harbor later on the 25th. Late the next day, she got underway on an escort assignment and convoyed {{USS|Stratford|AP-41|3}} to [[Green Island, Papua New Guinea|Green Island]], [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], arriving on the 29th to screen the transport as she unloaded. She eventually escorted the troopship to Emirau Island and [[Torokina]], Bougainville, before proceeding independently to the Treasury Islands. She conducted training exercises over the balance of September before she performed local escort missions and the like out of her Treasury Islands' base into October.  ''Willmarth'' departed Blanche Harbor on 6 October in company with {{USS|Whitehurst|DE-634|3}}, bound for Dutch New Guinea. She arrived three days later and sortied on the 12th with Task Unit (TU) 77.7.1 which included {{USS|Ashtabula|AO-51|3}}, {{USS|Saranac|AO-74|3}}, {{USS|Chepachet|AO-78|3}}, {{USS|Salamonie|AO-26|3}}, {{USS|Mazama|AE-9|3}}, and merchant ship {{SS|Pueblo}}. Other escorts were {{USS|Witter|DE-636|3}}, {{USS|Bowers|DE-637|3}}, and ''Whitehurst''.  ''Willmarth'' operated with TU 77.7.1 until she was released late on the 13th to escort ''Chepachet'' and SS ''Pueblo'' to [[Kossol Passage]], in the Palaus. Arriving there at 18:21 on the 14th, she remained anchored for two days before beginning to patrol the harbor entrance on the 17th. Relieved of this duty by {{USS|Lovelace|DE-198|3}}, ''Willmarth'' got underway during the forenoon on 20 October to screen the sortie of ''Ashtabula'', ''Saranac'', ''Chepachet'', ''Salamonie'', ''Mazama'', and {{SS|Durham Victory}} for the [[Philippines]].  ===Philippines campaign=== ''Willmarth'' proceeded north with her convoy, while American troops splashed ashore on the beaches of [[Leyte]] to commence the [[Philippines campaign, 1944-45|liberation of the Philippines]]. On the 23rd, three days after the main landing began, the destroyer escort anchored off Leyte midway between the northern and southern transport areas while her oilers refueled the ships from Task Group (TG) 77.2. That evening, ''Willmarth'' steamed eastward toward a night anchorage and, at 18:25, observed [[anti-aircraft]] fire over the northern transport area.  Underway again off [[Homonhon Island]] early the next morning, the destroyer escort received a report of enemy [[aircraft]] orbiting over the northern transport area. As she steamed along the convoy's flank, she commenced making black smoke at 08:44 to lay a protective screen in anticipation of the enemy's arrival. While the radio crackled with reports of ships under attack, ''Willmarth'' spotted no enemy planes nearby, only many puffs of \"flak\" splattering the skies to the westward of her screening position in the refueling group.  With the receipt of a \"flash white\" at 13:43, the oilers resumed refueling TG 77.2. ''Willmarth'' shifted to [[Samar Island]] shortly before 17:00 before going to general quarters at 17:06 upon receipt of a \"flash red.\" After waiting for well over an hour for the enemy to make an appearance, the convoy stopped and prepared to anchor for the night.  At 18:43, however, three [[Nakajima B6N|\"Jills\"]] roared in low from the east, [[torpedo]]es slung menacingly beneath their bellies. ''Willmarth's'' guns opened fire on two just before they released their \"fish.\" One torpedo holed ''Ashtabula'' and forced her to a halt, dead in the water. While the oiler's repair parties controlled the flooding and patched the hole, the convoy passed out of [[Leyte Gulf]] and reformed in the wake of the attack. Eventually, ''Ashtabula'', repairs effected, rejoined at 22:30.  ''Willmarth'' and the convoy remained underway throughout the evening, maneuvering on various courses and speeds in Leyte Gulf until the first rays of sunlight streaked the eastern skies. After going to general quarters at 04:58, the destroyer escort remained at battle stations throughout the day. Less than an hour after her crew first closed up at action stations, two \"Jills\" attacked the convoy from the westward. ''Willmarth'' immediately opened fire with her {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} and {{convert|1.1|in|mm|sing=on}} batteries. As one \"Jill\" roared across the stern of the convoy, it was caught by gunfire from ''Willmarth'' and other ships of the convoy and crashed in flames far astern.  While maneuvering and making smoke to mask the convoy, the destroyer escort spotted a floating [[naval mine|mine]] which she sank with gunfire. Soon thereafter, another \"Jill\" passed through the area and drew fire from ''Willmarth''. Unfortunately, the shells were not observed to hit; and the plane escaped.  The convoy anchored in the fueling area at 11:52, three hours after the last attack. ''Willmarth'' and the other escorts screened the convoy and provided an [[anti-submarine]] screen patrol around the valuable auxiliaries. Later that afternoon, ''Willmarth'' repulsed an attack made by a lone plane which came out of the sun in a glide-bombing attack at 14:20. The destroyer escort's gunfire damaged the plane and caused it to spin into the water about five miles (8&nbsp;km) away.  The convoy departed the fueling area at 16:46. Frequent alerts and enemy planes enlivened the evening hours as the group maneuvered throughout the night in a retirement formation. ''Willmarth's'' war diarist noted that the [[Japan]]ese planes seemed loathe to attack ships in the fueling area during daylight, probably because of the heavy concentration of anti-aircraft fire that could be directed at an attacker.  The next day, 26 October, saw a repetition of the same routine that had kept the destroyer escort active since her arrival in Leyte Gulf three days earlier. After maneuvering on screening duties through the night, the warship spotted a lone [[Aichi D3A|\"Val\" dive bomber]] making an attack at 05:50; ''Willmarth'' opened fire from {{convert|6000|yd}} but failed to score any hits. Within minutes, she and her sister escorts were laying smoke screens to cover the convoy for the next hour. Thereafter, they provided anti-submarine screening protection while the oilers conducted fueling operations.  ===Further escort duty=== After following the same routine on the 27th, ''Willmarth'' departed Leyte Gulf and headed for the [[Palaus]]. At 08:00 on 28 October, ''Willmarth'' — escorting the oilers earmarked to refuel the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]] ships — rendezvoused with the carriers of Task Group 77.4 and screened the refuelling operations for the balance of the day. Detached that afternoon, ''Willmarth'' screened ''Ashtabula'' and ''Chepachet'' as they voyaged to Kossol Roads, in the Palaus. Arriving on 31 October, ''Willmarth'' refueled from {{USS|Mascoma|AO-83|3}} and anchored, her job done.  The respite afforded the destroyer escort was a brief one, however, for she got underway on 1 November for [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] and [[Seeadler Harbor]], escorting a convoy. Entering [[Yos Sudarso Bay|Humboldt Bay]] on the 4th, ''Willmarth'' anchored there over the next two days before proceeding to sea to screen the sortie of TG 78.4 — {{HMS|Ariadne|M65|6}}, 12 [[Landing Ship Medium|LSM's]], 4 [[Landing Craft Infantry|LCI's]], 8 LCI(G)'s, {{USS|PC-1122||2}} and {{USS|PC-1133||2}} — on the 7th.  ===Western New Guinea campaign=== For the next three days, ''Willmarth'' screened the convoy to its destination — [[Mapia]] and [[Asia Islands]], near [[Morotai]] — before arriving in the invasion area on the 11th. As the convoy neared Morotai, ''Willmarth's'' lookouts observed anti-aircraft fire between 04:15 and 05:30. Two \"bogies\" passed within four miles (6&nbsp;km) of the convoy; but, as ''Wilmarth's'' war diarist recorded, \"evidently they either did not sight us or were not interested, as they proceeded directly toward the area from which flak appeared.\" There was a reason why ''Willmarth'' did not open fire on the two planes that seemed so close — she carried the only reliable air-warning radar in the entire convoy and to open fire prematurely would have disclosed the position of the little convoy and exposed it to possible air attacks. At 08:32, the destroyer escort anchored just off the southern coast of Morotai, near ''Ariadne'', while the remainder of the convoy (save the LCM's) proceeded to another part of the island to load for the impending invasion of Mapia and Asia Islands. The mission of the assault group was to establish weather station and [[LORAN]] — long range radio aid to navigation — facilities.  On 13 November, with the assault ships having embarked their troops, ''Willmarth'' got underway in company with TG 78.14, bound for [[Pegun Island]]. At 05:00, two days later — she was joined by {{USS|Shaw|DD-373|3}} and {{USS|Caldwell|DD-605|3}}. ''Willmarth'', the two destroyers, and ''PC-1122'' bombarded the southern part of the island prior to the landings and provoked no return fire from the beach. After a half-hour of firing, ''Ariadne'' signalled that \"H\" hour was 06:30, meaning that the first wave of [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT(A)s]] would hit the reef at that time.  ''Willmarth'' remained at her bombardment station for the rest of the morning, ceasing fire as the first assault wave splashed toward the beachhead. The accompanying LCI(G)'s laid their own barrage, thus obviating the need for the destroyers' gunfire. By noon, the island was in American hands. When surrounded, the remaining garrison — only 12 to 14 Japanese soldiers — committed suicide.  Meanwhile, since she was not needed for bombardment, ''Willmarth'' patrolled to the northward of the invasion beach and came across canoes full of natives to the north. One native, speaking good English, told ''Willmarth'' that the remainder of the Japanese garrison, about 170 men, had waded across the reef to [[Bras Island]] the previous night — thus accounting for the sparse reception given the invasion forces.  While plans were being laid to go after this remnant on Bras Island, ''Willmarth'' conducted anti-submarine patrol around the unloading assault craft and made abortive attempts to pull several LCI's that had been stranded by low tides off the reefs. At 17:30 on the 15th, the destroyer escort succeeded in towing one off after about an hour's time and began operations to free another one of the infantry assault craft. However, the destroyer escort's efforts were frustrated by the line's parting and the near approach of darkness.  Four LCI(G)'s had to be left on the reef — as was one LCI — when the task group headed for Morotai. Arriving on 17 November, ''Willmarth'' fueled from Salamonie before anchoring. Underway again on the 18th, with the Asia Island occupation force, ''Willmarth'' and two PC's served as escort for ''Ariadne'', four LCM's, four LCI's, and four LCI(G)'s. Embarked in the assault craft were 400 troops.  Three-fourths of a mile off [[Igi Island]], ''Willmarth'', ''Ariadne'', and ''PC-1122'' conducted shore bombardment from 05:42 to 06:19 on the 19th. Troops splashed ashore from landing craft eight minutes after the bombardment ceased and met no opposition. An unfortunate result of the shore bombardment was that two natives were wounded and one killed — the Japanese had evacuated the island in the face of imminent invasion the previous evening.  ''Willmarth'' subsequently screened the movement of the convoy to the [[Mapia Islands]], where the landing craft loaded troops and unloaded shore personnel and supplies. When the loading was completed at 18:00 on the 20th, the convoy shifted to Asia Island, where the destroyer escort screened the landing craft as they embarked more troops on the 21st. ''Willmarth'' continued her screening duties until arriving in the southernanchorage near the naval base at Morotai Island at 12:38 on 22 November. While there, the escort vessel witnessed an enemy night air raid on the airfield installations on Morotai. The Japanese boldly conducted their attacks despite anti-aircraft fire and searchlights. Local port restrictions forbade the use of any anti-aircraft batteries larger than 40 millimeter. ''Willmarth's'' war diary sadly noted this restriction, recommending that 3-inch gunfire could do very little damage to shore installations in the area.  While the rest of TG 78.14 departed Morotai on the 23rd, ''Willmarth'' remained behind as ''LSM-205'' and ''LSM-314'' loaded equipment for the Asia and Mapia Island forces. She then escorted those craft to Hollandia where they delivered their cargo. Over the next three days, ''Willmarth'' escorted the two landing craft on their appointed rounds, dropping off supplies at Asia and Mapia Islands. At one point, the arrival of the little convoy at Mapia on the 26th almost went unnoticed.  ''Willmarth'' experienced great difficulty contacting anyone on shore: \"We finally succeeded in rousing someone by blowing our siren and whistle together.\" A [[Willys MB|jeep]] soon appeared on the beach, its occupants using the headlights to signal. Heavier swells than at Asia Island made unloading through the surf difficult. One of the LSM's was holed several times by scraping on the jagged coral heads of the reef. When unloading was completed at 11:30, the diminutive convoy headed for Hollandia.  ===Service Squadron 4=== On 1 December 1944, ''Willmarth'' and the other ships from Escort Division 40 set sail for Manus, in the Admiralties, for assignment to [[Service Squadron 4]]. Arriving at Seeadler Harbor the following day, Willmarth spent the next three months operating on local escort missions between Manus, Ulithi, Hollandia, and the Palaus.  On 4 March 1945, ''Willmarth'' reported to the Commander, [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]], for duty. Between the 5th and 18th, she conducted anti-submarine patrols in the Palaus before being sent to Ulithi to refuel and replenish. She got underway again on the 21st to screen the sortie of TP 54 — the pre-invasion bombardment group — as it got underway for [[Okinawa]].  ===Okinawa campaign=== Assigned to screen TF 54, ''Willmarth'' operated with [[Naval gunfire support|Fire Support Unit]] 2 (TU 54.1.2) built around the [[battleship]] {{USS|Colorado|BB-45|3}}, in Fire Support (FS) areas 4 and 5, off Okinawa. The destroyer escort screened ''Colorado'' for the entire day on 26 March as the battleship delivered gunfire support for the troops ashore. Over the next two days, the warship screened fire support units and escorted them to night retirement areas. She was refuelled at Kerama Retto on the 30th before returning to screening duties with heavy units off the island.  On 1 April, she was steaming on station 16 of a circular screen around TU 54.3.2, a night retirement group built around the [[battleship]] {{USS|Idaho|BB-42|3}}, when several enemy planes flew near the convoy. Screening destroyers fired upon the intruders who probably did not come to attack the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] force but merely to keep it awake and permit it little rest.  Detached from this duty to provide a screen for {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|3}}, one of the oldest battleships on active service in the Navy, ''Willmarth'' operated to seaward as the battleship worked inshore to open fire on Japanese positions holding up the American advance near [[Naha Airport]]. After commencing this duty at 06:30, ''Willmarth'' had been serving on anti-submarine patrol for over six hours when Japanese [[shore battery]] guns boomed out salvoes at ''Arkansas''.  ''Arkansas{{'}}'' main battery trained 'round to reply and quickly commenced [[counter-battery fire]]. At the time of the initial firing, ''Willmarth'' was located about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) southwestward of the battleship, maintaining her screening position to seaward. At 13:23, a Japanese shell hurtled over ''Willmarth's'' bridge \"plainly heard\" by all men there. It splashed beyond the ship, {{convert|150|yd}} away. With only one boiler operating (the other had been secured to repair a leaking gasket) the destroyer escort was hampered in getting away, but she headed seaward at her best speed. Soon another shell landed only {{convert|15|yd}} beyond the destroyer escort's starboard quarter. While increasing the range, ''Willmarth'' turned toward each splash, thus avoiding getting hit by the Japanese guns. ''Arkansas'', by this time beyond gun range of the Nipponese guns, did not conduct any further counter-battery fire; Willmarth soon emerged from the enemy battery's zone of fire and proceeded to sea unscathed.  ===Attacked by Kamikaze=== After retiring to Kerama Retto soon thereafter for fueling, ''Willmarth'' operated on screening station A-27 until 6 April, when she returned to Kerama Retto with an [[appendicitis]] patient on board for medical treatment. Several bogies flew near the ship while she steamed to the fleet anchorage, and one was downed by a nearby ship at 02:00.  At 15:25, while still three miles (5&nbsp;km) north of Kerama Retto, ''Willmarth'' spotted three \"Val\" dive bombers. One peeled off and maneuvered to make an attack. Ten minutes later, it attempted to crash into the ship. Bracketed by flak, the \"Val\" bore in, apparently intent on crashing into the destroyer escort. Heavy {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} and {{convert|1.1|in|mm|sing=on}} fire bracketed the plane when she became visible, dodging in and out of the broken clouds overhead. Seven {{convert|3|in|mm|sing=on}} bursts rocked the plane as she made her deadly approach. Lookouts on the destroyer escort noted a thin line of smoke tracking from the suicider's port wing as he went into his dive. The 20-millimeter battery on ''Wilmarth'' opened fire when the plane's range lessened to {{convert|2000|yd}}; and, at {{convert|800|yd}}, the Oerlikons seemed to have their effect. Pieces of the \"Val's\" wing began flying off in the slipstream, indicating that the shells were beginning to hit. Six feet of the port wing soon broke away, shot off by the flak, and the \"Val\" spun into the sea {{convert|20|yd}} off the ship's port side, slightly abaft her beam.  ''Willmarth'' entered Kerama Retto at 16:10; and, while preparing to anchor, saw {{USS|LST-447||2}} hit by a suicide plane south of the harbor entrance. Flames had engulfed the entire amidships section of the stricken landing ship, and explosions tore holes in the stricken ship's side. The jagged edges in turn ripped gashes in ''Willmarth's'' hull at the waterline. One hole, unfortunately, opened up one of the destroyer escort's fuel tanks, and the oil leaking out made further close operations hazardous.  ''Willmarth'' stood clear while dense smoke from the burning LST further complicated firefighting. Eventually, the destroyer escort picked up the ship's survivors and later transferred them to  {{USS|Crescent City|APA-21|3}}. While steaming to the ship's anchorage in the harbor, she took an enemy plane under fire as it approached from the south; and multiple gunfire from all ships present in the habor knocked it down.  ''Willmarth'' anchored, transferred her appendicitis patient ashore, and patched the hole in her side caused by the damaged ''LST-447'' before proceeding on the 7th to screening station \"Able-60\" near the transport area off the west coast of Okinawa. Following her shift to another screening station on the morning of the 8th, ''Willmarth'' escorted {{USS|Saranac|AO-74|3}} to Kerama Retto on the 9th. On 10 April, the destroyer escort departed the Okinawa area, bound for [[Guam]] in the screen for 12 transports.  ===Screening 3rd Fleet logistics force === Arriving at Guam on the 14th, ''Willmarth'' developed boiler trouble while there and spent the entire month of May and most of June undergoing repairs. On 28 June, the destroyer escort got underway for Ulithi. En route, she picked up a sonar contact, and in company with {{USS|Trippe|DD-403|3}}, over the ensuing two days, conducted an unsuccessful hunt. ''Willmarth'' then proceeded on to Ulithi where she arrived on the last day of June.  Underway again on 3 July, ''Willmarth'' stood out of Ulithi lagoon screening the logistics force of the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]] which would provide the needed supplies for Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.|William F. Halsey]]'s [[fast carrier task force]]s as it pounded the Japanese homeland. During the passage north, the destroyer escort planeguarded for {{USS|Steamer Bay|CVE-87|3}} and conducted anti-submarine screening operations. She picked up the crew of a downed [[TBF Avenger]] on 20 July. On that occasion, two swimmers from ''Willmarth'' helped to get the downed airmen on board. However, one of the crewmen died. The two survivors and the body of the dead man were transferred to ''Steamer Bay'' later that day.  ''Willmarth'' subsequently planeguarded for {{USS|Gilbert Islands|CVE-107|3}} in early August, continuing her screening and escort duties with TG-30 — the replenishment group for the 3rd Fleet. She was at sea when the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs were dropped upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] on 6 and 9 August, respectively, and when [[Surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered on the 15th]].  ===Post-war activities=== ''Willmarth'' remained on escort duty off the coast of Japan into September. In mid-September, the ship underwent an availability in [[Tokyo Bay]] and rode out a storm there on 18 September. Departing Tokyo Bay on 24 September to return to the United States, ''Willmarth'' touched at Pearl Harbor, San Diego, and the [[Panama Canal]] before undergoing an overhaul at [[Norfolk, Virginia]] which lasted until late in October.  ===Decommissioning and disposal=== Shifting to the [[St. Johns River]], [[Florida]], soon thereafter, ''Willmarth'' prepared for inactivation with the Florida group of the 16th (Reserve) Fleet. Berthed in the [[Green Cove Springs]] facility, ''Willmarth'' was decommissioned on 26 April 1946 and placed in reserve. She remained there until struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 1 December 1966. Sold on 1 July 1968 to the [[North American Smelting Company]], of [[Wilmington, Delaware]], the ship was broken up for scrap soon thereafter.  ==Awards== ''Willmarth'' received four [[battle star]]s for her participation in [[World War II]].  ==References== *{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w9/willmarth.htm|http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/escorts/de638.txt}}  ==External links== * {{navsource|06/638|USS Willmarth}}   {{Buckley class destroyer escort}}  {{DEFAULTSORT:Willmarth (DE-638)}} [[Category:Buckley-class destroyer escorts]] [[Category:Ships built in San Francisco, California]] [[Category:1943 ships]] [[Category:World War II frigates and destroyer escorts of the United States]]</td></tr><tr><td>Manitoba Highway 32</td><td>3343252</td><td>674171874</td><td>2015-08-02T04:27:04.000+0000</td><td>SporkBot</td><td>12406635</td><td>{{Refimprove|date=August 2013}} {{Infobox road |province=MB |type=Hwy |route=32 |alternate_name= |map= |length_km= 23 |direction_a=South |terminus_a={{jct|state=ND|SR|32}} ([[Canada – United States border]]) |direction_b=North |terminus_b={{jct|state=MB|PTH|14|PR|428}} near [[Winkler, Manitoba|Winkler]] |towns=[[Winkler, Manitoba|Winkler]] |established=1957 |previous_type=Hwy |previous_route=31 |next_type=Hwy |next_route=34 }} '''Provincial Trunk Highway 32''' ('''PTH 32''') is a provincial highway in the [[Canadian]] province of [[Manitoba]].

It became an immediate bestseller in Turkey, with several hundred thousand copies sold as of 2006.  The book gained international attention mainly because of its plot about a war between Turkey and the United States (who are [[NATO]] allies) and because of its enthusiastic reception in Turkey. According to the Turkish newspaper ''[[Radikal gazetesi|Radikal]]'', \"the Foreign Ministry and General Staff are reading it keenly\" and \"all cabinet members also have it\".  The book's plot and reception is thought by most observers to reflect an increasing level of [[Anti-Americanism]] in the wake of the [[War on Terror]], the [[Iraq War]] and especially the \"[[hood event|2003 Hood Event]]\" that was perceived as a national humiliation in Turkey.  The U.S. government in the novel is led by a nameless [[President of the United States|president]] reminiscent of [[George W. Bush]] and portrayed as an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] zealot. It also includes real-life U.S. Cabinet members [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]]. The novel also features then-current real-life political leaders at the helm of their respective nations. ==Plot== In 2007, the [[United States]] invades [[Turkey]] to gain control of its deposits of an important strategic resource, [[borax]]. After securing the principal cities in Turkey, the United States attempts to re-enact the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] by dividing Turkey up between its historic rivals [[Greece]] and [[Armenia]]. Turkey responds by forming a military alliance with [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Germany]]. A Turkish agent then steals an American nuclear bomb and detonates it in [[Washington, D.C.]], killing millions of people. This however, backfires and U.S. troops increase their abuse of occupied Turkish citizens and the invasion picks up in pace. When American troops reach Istanbul, the conflict degrades to urban combat between U.S. forces, Turkish armed citizenry, Turkish Army remnants and police forces. The climax turns out to be anticlimactic; the occupation of Istanbul agitates Russia, the [[European Union]] and China to sign a military alliance and threaten the United States with nuclear warfare in order to stop the invasion. The war comes to a close; U.S. forces retreat, and Turkey is saved. The agent, a member of a secret Turkish intelligence agency named \"The Grey Team\", trained from birth as obedient and amoral orphans, kidnaps the mastermind behind the invasion, the CEO of a corporation funding the U.S. President, and the book ends with a Central Asian torture scene with said CEO.  == See also == * [[Turkey-United States relations]] * ''[[Valley of the Wolves Iraq]]'', a 2006 Turkish film also featuring a Turkish-U.S. conflict  == References == * {{cite news | first = | last = | author = Ted Widmer | coauthors = | title = Death to the Crusade | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140531063105/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/18/books/review/18widmer.html| work = | publisher = [[New York Times]] | pages = | page = | date = September 18, 2005 | accessdate = May 31, 2014| language = }} * {{cite news | first = | last = | author = Soli Özel | coauthors = | title = The Gathering Storm | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100212033933/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2005/07/01/the_gathering_storm | format = | work = | publisher = [[Foreign Policy]] | pages = | page = | date = July–August 2005 | accessdate = February 12, 2010| language = }} * {{cite news | first = | last = | author = Yigal Schleifer | coauthors = | title = Sure it's fiction.

It was formed from [[Christiana Hundred]] and [[New Castle Hundred]] in 1710 and was named for [[White Clay Creek]] that flows along its northern boundary.    Originally, the default boundary of [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] was the vague height of land between the [[Delaware River]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]] drainage basins and White Clay Creek Hundred extended to that point.  With the running of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] in 1767, the western boundary of [[Delaware]] was established in its present location and became White Clay Creek Hundred’s western boundary.  It was the gap between this line and the existing western boundary, the [[The Twelve-Mile Circle|12 mile arc]] drawn around the town of [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], which created the long-disputed area known as [[The Wedge (border)|the Wedge]].  ==Development==  Except for some preserved woods along [[White Clay Creek]], this area is now completely urban and suburban with continuous industrial, commercial and residential developments, much of it in the small city of [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], the location of the [[University of Delaware]].

It protects diverse coastal habitat, including part of the 220&nbsp;km² [[Iguéla Lagoon]], the only significant example of a typical western [[Africa]]n [[lagoon]] system that is protected within a national park.  Situated between the [[Nkomi]] and [[Ndogo Lagoon]]s, Loango National Park is the true jewel of Africa's western coast. The naturalist [[J. Michael Fay|Mike Fay]] called Loango 'Africa's Last Eden' and this is where Michael \"Nick\" Nichols from [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] took his well-known pictures of surfing hippos. Both men call Loango the 'Land of surfing hippos'. The park’s 1,550&nbsp;km² of savanna, pristine beach, forest and mangroves are a must-see in Gabon. Loango National Park offers breathtaking panoramas and the unique opportunity to observe elephants, buffalos, hippos, gorillas and leopards venturing onto the white sand beaches.  After South Africa, the world’s largest concentration and variety of whales and dolphins can be found right off the Loango coast. The area has over 100 kilometres of uninhabited coastline and [[humpback whale|humpback]] and [[killer whale]]s are easy to observe here. This is arguably the most beautiful spot on Africa's western coast – the place where forests, savannas, wetlands, lagoons and ocean all come together. Loango is renowned worldwide as a site for tarpon of record size, as well as many other large saltwater fish.  The [[World Conservation Union]] or International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), an international organization dedicated to natural resource conservation, classed Loango National Park as a faunal reserve and protected area for conservation.  ==The history of Loango National Park== In 1956 the first regional faunal reserves were created in and around Loango National Park to promote sustainable use of the area’s wildlife and wild lands. In November 2002, President [[Omar Bongo Ondimba]] put Gabon firmly on the map by creating 13 new national parks in Gabon. All together, the thirteen parks created represent 10% of the landmass of Gabon. One of the more spectacular parks in this system is Loango National Park. Very few villages currently exist within the park, as most are located on the opposite bank of the Ngove Lagoon. As such, the park is nearly devoid of people and home only to a vast and spectacular array of terrestrial, avian and marine wildlife. While some of these animals inhabit specific ecological niches to which they have been adapting over time immemorial, others such as elephants and buffalos range across a number of landscapes. Many of the animals can be encountered by visitors on foot, in a vehicle, or seen from a blind.  ==Tourism and conservation go hand in hand in Loango National Park== Rombout Swanborn, a pioneering Dutch investor in ‘Conservation Tourism’ developed ''SCD'' (''Société de Conservation de Developpement''). Research, park management and educational activities are performed in partnership with WCS. Also, he created ''Africa’s Eden'', developing the infrastructure and logistics to provide high-end nature tourism experiences in remote parts of Gabon (and from 2006 in [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] as well) based on the concept \"Tourism pays for Conservation\".  ==The people of Loango National Park== Like most peoples around the globe, the human inhabitants of the Loango area remain dependent on the natural resources that surround them for their daily needs. Today, although some Gabonese citizens have migrated toward the urban centres or taken up employment within modern industries, such as oil and timber production, most individuals living in traditional villages still depend heavily upon their natural surroundings for their day-to-day needs.  Village-dwelling peoples use a slash-and-burn agricultural technique and grow a number of domesticated plant species including manioc, peanuts, and mustard greens. Women are responsible for most of the gardening, save for the preliminary felling and clearing of trees and brush. Men make their living by [[fishing]] or [[hunting]].

Born in [[Pittston, Maine]], he completed preparatory studies, attended [[Colby College]], graduated from [[George Washington University|Columbia College]] (Washington, D.C.) in 1830 and from the [[Harvard Law School]]. He was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] and practiced in [[Bangor, Maine]]; he was city solicitor from 1834 to 1837. From 1850 to 1853 he engaged with his brother in operating a [[steamboat]] line upon the [[Chagres River]], [[Isthmus of Panama]]. He moved to California and engaged in [[gold mining]] for two years, after which he returned to Bangor and practiced law.  In 1857 he moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and continued the practice of law; in 1866 he was a member of the [[Missouri House of Representatives]]. Jewett was appointed as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of [[Charles D. Drake]] and served from December 19, 1870, to January 20, 1871, when a successor was elected. He declined to be a candidate for election to the Senate to fill this vacancy and resumed the practice of law.  Jewett died in St. Louis in 1906, and was buried at [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]].  ==References== {{CongBio|J000103}}  {{s-start}} {{s-par|us-sen}} {{U.S. Senator box |state=Missouri |class=3 |before=[[Charles D.

As its name suggests, the channel is a commercial service that primarily broadcasts films.  ==History== In November 2000, [[Canwest]], through its subsidiary Global Television Network Inc., was granted approval by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) to launch a television channel called ''Adventure'', described as \"a national English-language Category 2 specialty television service devoted to action and adventure programming. Its program schedule will run the gamut from contemporary \"popcorn\" action and adventure films and series, to classical westerns, rodeo and western horse shows.\"<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2000/DB2000-571.htm Decision CRTC 2000-571] CRTC 2000-12-14</ref>   The channel was launched under the name '''Lonestar''' on September 7, 2001, focusing exclusively on Western and rural-themed programming such as films, television dramas, and lifestyle series. After a few years, Lonestar began to air more general action and adventure programming unrelated to the Western theme of its early years, a considerable amount of that being movies, to the point where they made up the majority of the schedule.  On August 21, 2008, Canwest announced that Lonestar would be rebranded as '''MovieTime''', focusing on contemporary films. The name change took effect on October 6, 2008.<ref>Hank, Melissa.

The {{Convert|43|acre|sing=on}} is situated northwest of the [[Brown County Reforestation Camp]], {{convert|11|mi|km}}, which together cover {{convert|1560|acre|km2}} and have over a half million visitors each year.  The NEW Zoo does not receive local or regional tax support for its annual operating budget.<ref name=\"zoo_about\"/>  == History == {{One source|section|date=December 2014}} The area where the zoo is located was covered with pine and oak forests when European settlers began arriving in the 1800s.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/> Intensive lumbering soon cleared most of the land and residents began planting crops. Once the forests were gone, there were no leaves or logs left to decompose and replenish the sandy soil and the soil was no longer able to produce crops. In the late 1800s, [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]] acquired the {{convert|1600|acre|km2|adj=on}} area that makes up the Reforestation Camp.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/>  In 1948, sparks from a passing train set fire to {{convert|80|acre}} of county land and destroyed what was left of the forest. This prompted the County Board to build an open prison camp and plant trees, hence the name Brown County Reforestation Camp. Beginning in 1950, Harry Barth, the first camp superintendent, and his wife directed inmates in planting 250,000 white pine, Norway pine, Jack pine, cedar, and spruce seedlings.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/> This continued for several years until the sandy wasteland was once again green forest.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/>  During the 1950s, the reforestation camp became part of the county park system. Ponds were dug for fire protection and recreation and fish were stocked. Hiking and ski trails were established. By 1952, bear, deer and timber-wolves were exhibited at the park and the zoo was established.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/>  In 1985, the county board decided to cease providing funds for capital improvements at the zoo. Since then, all new animal exhibits and major improvements have been financed by the NEW Zoological Society, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, and by private donations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newzoo.org/zoological-society/|title=Zoological Society|work=newzoo.org|publisher=Northeast Wisconsin Zoo|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref>  The most recent addition to the zoo, the Adventure Park, includes dual \"racing\" zip lines, an aerial adventure course, and a climbing tower.<ref name=\"zoo_adventure\"/> The park was built to appear minimally invasive and naturally appealing.<ref name=\"zoo_adventure\"/> For example, the historic fire tower, built in 1955, is now the starting point for the dual \"racing\" zip lines.<ref name=\"zoo_adventure\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://whoonew.com/2014/05/discover-the-new-zoo-adventure-park-an-adrenaline-rush-thats-close-to-home/ |title=Discover the NEW Zoo Adventure Park-An Adrenaline Rush That's Close to Home |work=whoonew.com |publisher=Ashley Steinbrinck |accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref>  == Exhibits == Many types of native plants and animals can be found at the zoo, which features more than 92 exhibits with more than 215 animals from around the world.<ref name=\"brown_county\"/>  === Penguin exhibit === Located near the main entrance of the zoo, the penguin exhibit is home to both the [[African penguin]] and the [[South African shelduck]].<ref name=\"zoo_about\"/> In the spring of 2013, the [[Species Survival Plan]] allowed two of the zoo's penguins to breed and visitors could view the baby penguin later that fall.

Roland''' (September 15, 1921 in [[Dallas]] &ndash; August 11, 1982 in [[New York]]) was a [[jazz]] [[composer]] and [[musician]] who played many instruments during his career but was most significant as an arranger/composer and for his association with [[Stan Kenton]]. Roland was the only arranger to write for Kenton in all four decades of the band's existence.<ref>Michael Sparke, ''Stan Kenton&nbsp;– This Is an Orchestra!'', excerpt from one of the photo pages between pps 142 & 143, University of North Texas Press (2010)</ref>  ==Life and work== Roland, who gained a degree in music from the [[University of North Texas College of Music]], first met up with Kenton in 1944, playing fifth [[trumpet]] and contributing arrangements. He worked briefly with [[Lionel Hampton]] and [[Lucky Millinder]] and then rejoined Kenton in 1945, this time as a [[trombonist]] and writer (he arranged the hit \"Tampico\").  Roland played [[piano]] and wrote for a group in 1946 that included [[Stan Getz]], [[Zoot Sims]], [[Jimmy Giuffre]] and [[Herbie Steward]] and would lead to [[Woody Herman]]'s Four Brothers Second Herd. In the late 1940s, Roland played trombone with [[Georgie Auld]], trumpet with [[Count Basie]], [[Charlie Barnet]] and Lucky Millinder and contributed charts for the big bands of [[Claude Thornhill]] and [[Artie Shaw]]. After leading a giant rehearsal band in 1950 that included [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charlie Parker]], Roland wrote for Kenton in 1951, [[Dan Terry]] in 1954, and Woody Herman from 1956–58, for whom he contributed 65 arrangements. Roland was a major force in Kenton's [[mellophonium]] band of the early 1960s, not only writing for the ensemble but performing as one of the [[mellophoniums]]; he also occasionally doubled on soprano sax with the orchestra.  Gene Roland provided the robust vocal on \"Hawaiian Teenage Girl\" (composed by Bob Bertram), issued on a 49th State Record Company as 45 rpm record HRC-314A.  Roland remained active as a writer in the 1960s and 70s, working with the Radiohus Orchestra in [[Copenhagen]] (1967) and contributing charts to Kenton as well as Dan Terry's D.T.B.B.B. album (Metronome Records, 1981); he also played trumpet, piano and tenor with his own groups. In addition to writing an entire album for Kenton, Roland led his 1950 rehearsal band on a [[Spotlite Records|Spotlite]] release ([[Charlie Parker|Parker]] is one of his sidemen), led half of an album (recorded in 1957 and 1959) for [[Dawn Records]] in which he plays trumpet, and arranged a 1963 octet record for [[Brunswick Records]].  == References == {{reflist|2}}  == External links == * [http://home.comcast.net/~nwedder/roland2page.htm Gene Roland ''A Composer/Arranger For All The Right Reasons and Seasons''] * [http://www.honors.umd.edu/HONR269J/projects/boyd.html Stan Kenton: Progressive Concepts in Jazz] * [http://www.middlehornleader.com/Kenton%20Mellophoniums.htm Stan Kenton's Mellophonium Band] *[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/RR/frodd.html Biography in Handbook of Texas]  {{Authority control}}  {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. --> | NAME              = Roland, Gene | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = American composer | DATE OF BIRTH     = September 15, 1921 | PLACE OF BIRTH    = | DATE OF DEATH     = August 11, 1982 | PLACE OF DEATH    = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Roland, Gene}} [[Category:American jazz composers]] [[Category:American music arrangers]] [[Category:1921 births]] [[Category:1982 deaths]] [[Category:People from Dallas, Texas]] [[Category:University of North Texas alumni]] [[Category:20th-century composers]] [[Category:20th-century American musicians]]</td></tr><tr><td>Juliet O'Neill</td><td>7009414</td><td>672322994</td><td>2015-07-20T20:31:11.000+0000</td><td>Egsan Bacon</td><td>603343</td><td>'''Juliet O'Neill ''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] journalist who was the subject of controversy when the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] raided her house in 2004 in an attempt to find the source of an alleged internal leak giving her access to privileged documents related to the [[Maher Arar]] case.  ==Career== In 1986, O'Neill was working for the [[Canadian Press]] newswire, when she caught international attention for being the only reporter to capture [[Sondra Gotlieb]] slapping her social [[secretary]] Connie Gibson Connor at a [[state dinner]] held to honour Canadian Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] and US Vice President [[George H.

Her mother, Ortencia, worked in a tire factory.<ref name=\"Biography Today\">{{cite book |last=|first=|title=Biography Today|year=2009|page=21|publisher=Omnigraphics|location=[[Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-7808-1052-5}}</ref> She was raised in [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]], [[Los Angeles]] (a predominately African-American and Mexican-American neighborhood), in an all-female household composed of her mother, her aunts Rita and Delia, and her grandmother Francisca.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.22\">\"Biography Today\", pp.22</ref> Her grandmother was an herbal healer and practiced [[Curandero|curanderismo]],<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.22\"/> which profoundly influenced her sense of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Chicano]] culture.  Baca's mother later married Clarence Ferrari in 1952, and Baca has a half-brother Gary and half-sister Diane.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.21</ref> Afterward the three of them moved to [[Pacoima, Los Angeles]]. This neighborhood was drastically different from Watts – Mexican-Americans were minorities in Pacoima.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.22\"/>  ===Education=== Baca was not allowed to speak Spanish in elementary school, as it was prohibited, and did not know English very well. Her teacher would tell her to go paint in the corner while the others studied. It took some time, but Baca started getting better in classes once she was able to understand the textbooks. With the encouragement of her art teacher she began drawing and painting. She later graduated from [[Bishop Alemany High School]] in 1964.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.22\"/>  She then attended [[California State University, Northridge]] (CSUN) and earned her Bachelor's degree in 1969 and Master's degree in art in 1979. While there, she learned and studied [[Abstract art|modern abstract art]]. She wanted to make art that was accessible beyond the constraints of the gallery and the museum. She wanted to make art for the people she loved, but she knew that they didn't go to galleries. \"I thought to myself, if I get my work into galleries, who will go there? People in my family hadn't ever been in a gallery in their entire lives. My neighbors never went to galleries...And it didn't make sense to me at the time to put art behind some guarded wall.\"<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.23</ref>  After completing graduate school, Baca continued her education, studying muralism at Taller [[David Alfaro Siqueiros|Siqueiros]] in [[Cuernavaca, Mexico]].  ===Teacher and other jobs=== When she graduated from CSUN she got a job teaching at her former high school. Her students were not very friendly with each other, and she thought she had an idea about how to teach them to cooperate with each other. She had a group of her students make a mural on one side of the school's wall. Everybody wanted to work on it, and it encouraged them to work things out without fighting. Baca was present at the 1970 [[Chicano Moratorium]], an [[anti-war]] action of the [[Chicano Movement]]. The principal of the school believed teachers should not take part in the protest marches, and she was fired with several other teachers.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.25</ref>  After being fired, she thought she could never get another job because of her involvement in the protests. She would find her next job at the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department. Her new job was teaching art for a summer program in the city's public parks. At that time [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles]] had the most Mexican-Americans and the highest number of gangs in the country. Members of different gangs loitered in the parks she worked at, and she noticed the graffiti and knew they were territorial markings. \"You could read a wall and learn everything you needed to know about that community.\" One of her favorites was, \"I'd rather spend one day as a lion than a hundred as a lamb.\"<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.25-26</ref>  ===''Las Vistas Nuevas''=== In the summer of 1970, Baca decided to create a mural in Boyle Heights in order to bring community together. In the first team she had twenty members from four different gangs, and the group decided on the name ''Las Vistas Nuevas'' (\"New Views\"). The mural they would create would show images that would be familiar to the Mexican-Americans who were living in the neighborhood. \"I want to use public space to create a public voice for, and a public consciousness about people who are, in fact, the majority of the population but who are not represented in any visual way.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.26</ref>  ====''Mi Abuelita''==== Their first project was on three walls of an outdoor stage in [[Hollenbeck Park]]. ''Mi Abuelita'' (\"My Grandmother\") was a mural that depicted a Mexican-American grandmother with her arms outstretched as if to give a hug. \"This work recognized the primary position of the matriarch in Mexican families. It also marked the first step in the development of a unique collective process that employs art to mediate between rival gang members competing for public space and public identity.\" <ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.26-27\">\"Biography Today\", pp.26-27</ref>  Local police did not like the idea of rival gang members working together, fearing it would spark gang violence. Baca also began to work on the mural without permission from the city or the manager of Hollenbeck Park, which engendered questions from her supervisor and other city officials.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.27</ref>  Despite all these troubles, Baca wanted to finish the project. She had lookouts who would signal the mural team if rival gang members were headed toward the work site, or if the police were coming. One day a city official came to the park because he had been getting complaints about the project. After seeing the progress done and team members working so well with each other, he gave Baca permission from the city to complete the mural. \"The city was amazed at the work I was doing, making murals with kids who scared directors out of neighborhood centers.\"<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.28\">\"Biography Today\", pp.28</ref>  After its completion, the community loved ''Mi Abuelita''. Baca said, \"Everybody related to it. People brought candles to that site. For 12 years people put flowers at the base of the grandmother image.\" ''Las Vistas Nuevas'' would complete a total of three murals that summer.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.28\"/>  After the murals she was offered a job in 1970 as the director of a new citywide mural program. She was in charge of creating this program from the ground up, which included choosing where murals would go, designing the murals, and supervising the mural painting teams, which would consist of teenagers who were in trouble with the police. Members of the original ''Las Vistas Nuevas'' group were hired to help run Baca's multi-site program. This group would go on to paint more than 500 murals.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.28\"/>  In this new job she encountered her first problems with [[censorship]]. People in neighborhoods where murals were being created wanted to show all parts of life in their neighborhood, both the good and bad. The city, however, did not want any controversial subjects depicted in these murals. In one case, when the city objected to a mural that showed people struggling with police, they threatened to stop funding the program if Baca did not remove it. Baca said, \"I really liked the idea that the work could not be owned by anyone. So, therefore it wasn't going to be interesting to the rich or to the wealthy, and it didn't have to meet the caveats of art that museums would be interested in. Rather than give in , she formed the [[Social and Public Art Resource Center]] (SPARC) in 1976 to continue funding the creation of murals in public.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.28-29</ref>  Baca’s efforts to include community in her artistic processes make her unique to her time. Bringing youth together to create art left a lasting impression in Los Angeles, shifting Chicano/a culture. The involvement of poor youth of color in Baca’s artistic processes changed the way white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchal culture perceived their place in society. Perhaps even more importantly, Baca’s Citywide Mural Program strengthened community and gave people a sense of purpose.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Raising Community Consciousness with Public Art: Contrasting Projects by Judy Baca and Andrew Leicester on JSTOR|url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/3109047?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=judy&searchText=baca&searchUri=%25252Faction%25252FdoBasicResults%25253FQuery%25253Djudy%25252Bbaca%252526amp%25253Bacc%25253Don%252526amp%25253Bwc%25253Don%252526amp%25253Bfc%25253Doff%252526amp%25253Bgroup%25253Dnone%252526amp%25253Bvf%25253Djo&seq=6#page_scan_tab_contents|website = www.jstor.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04|last = Doss|first = Erika}}</ref>  '''Feminism and Art'''  On many levels, Judy Baca’s art is feminist. Baca moved community in a way that is feminist and intersectional. As a Chicana woman, she wanted to empower women of color and bring community together in Los Angeles. Baca did so by illuminating the beauty and power enriched in Chicana culture through public art. The processes behind the images that Baca created are equally powerful—Baca’s premise in her artistic process was to involve disempowered youth in order to evoke a sense of community and enable growth. In some ways, these acts cause Baca’s art to be feminist. On the other hand, identity is personal, and only Baca has the agency to identify herself and her art as feminist.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Stepping out of the Beaten Path: Reassessing the Feminist Art Movement on JSTOR|url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/521062?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=judy&searchText=baca&searchText=feminist&searchUri=%25252Faction%25252FdoBasicSearch%25253FQuery%25253Djudy%25252Bbaca%25252Bfeminist%252526amp%25253Bacc%25253Don%252526amp%25253Bwc%25253Don%252526amp%25253Bfc%25253Doff%252526amp%25253Bgroup%25253Dnone|website = www.jstor.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04|last = Brodsky|first = Judith K.|authorlink = |last2 = Olin|first2 = Ferris}}</ref>  ==SPARC==  ===''Great Wall of Los Angeles''=== Their first project was the ''[[Great Wall of Los Angeles]]''. She was hired by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] to help improve the area around a [[San Fernando Valley]] flood control channel called the [[Tujunga Wash]]. It's essentially a ditch that contained a large concrete retaining wall. Her idea for a mural was to paint a history of the city of [[Los Angeles]], but not the version found in history books. The events that were overlooked were the ones that interested her. \"It was an excellent place to bring youth of varied ethnic backgrounds from all over the city to work on an alternate view of the history of the U.S. which included people of color who had been left out of American history books.\" Baca also said the defining metaphor of the mural would be that \"It is a tattoo on the scar where the river once ran.\"<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.29-30</ref>  Baca was inspired by ''Los tres Grandes'' (\"The Three Greats\"), a novel about three of the most influential Mexican muralists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[José Clemente Orozco]]. In 1977 she attended a workshop at the Taller Siqueiros in [[Cuernavaca]], [[Mexico]], to learn muralism techniques and see their murals in person. Even though all three were deceased by that time, she was able to work with some of Siqueiros' former students.  When she returned and began this project, Baca made the explicit decision to involve people from the community that represented voices that have been historically marginalized. At the beginning of the muraling project in 1976, Baca began work alongside 80 young people who had been referred to the program by the criminal justice department.<ref name=\"sparcinla.org\">{{Cite web|title = The Great Wall – History and Description - SPARCinLA|url = http://sparcinla.org/the-great-wall-part-2/|website = sparcinla.org|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}</ref> For Baca, this marling project was about more than just painting a mural, but rather about investing in the community in ways that had not been done before. Baca took the lead on the project by interviewing people about their lives, family histories, ancestry, and stories they remembered hearing from their older relatives, as well as consulting history experts. From this, she was able to create the design for the mural. Some of the events portrayed in the mural constituted the first time they had ever been displayed in public, including but not limited to the [[Dust Bowl]] Journey, [[Japanese American internment]] during [[World War II]], [[Zoot Suit Riots]], and the [[Freedom Rides|Freedom Bus Rides]].<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.30-31</ref>  Baca wanted the project to be done by people who were as diverse as those to be painted. Baca states that “I draw on skills not normally used by artists. I’ve learned as much as I’ve taught from the youth I’ve had the good fortune to know by working alongside of them”.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Great Wall of Los Angeles {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|url = http://www.judybaca.com/artist/portfolio/the-great-wall/|website = www.judybaca.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}</ref> In this way, although the term [[artivism]] had not yet been coined at the time of this project, by focusing on the process and involving the community in creating public art work that shared the histories of marginalized people; Judy Baca was engaging in an artivist project. Working with young people was important for Baca because she noticed that many of them who were involved in gangs were also using graffiti to express themselves and claim territory. Baca felt that muralism was one way to redirect these young people’s energy and build community through positive experiences.<ref name=\"Everett 2007 88\">{{Cite book|title = Learning Race and Ethnicity: Youth and Digital Media|last = Everett|first = Anna|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2007|isbn = 0262550679|location = |pages = 88}}</ref>  Even though Baca made a lot of progress in building community with gang involved young people, she struggled with how gendered muraling projects and spaces were. Most of the young people she worked with were young men because as Baca stated “at that time, boys were the only ones parents would allow”.<ref name=\"Everett 2007 88\"/> But Baca also found that there was hostility towards the idea of women in these public spaces and to feminist ideals in general. Because of this, when it came to the Great Wall of LA project, Baca began to actively work to connect to other feminist artists and to actively recruit young women to participate in her muraling projects.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Learning Race and Ethnicity: Youth and Digital Media|last = Everett|first = Anna|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2007|isbn = 0262550679|location = |pages = 89}}</ref>  She had people from all different ages and backgrounds participate. Some were scholars and artists, but the majority were just community members. \"Making a mural is like a big movie production, it can involve 20 sets of scaffolding, four trucks, and food for 50 people.\" 400 people came out to help paint the mural, which took seven summers to complete, and was finished in 1984.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.31\">\"Biography Today\", pp.31</ref> By the end of the project, the mural measured half a mile in length (2,754 feet),<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Great Wall of Los Angeles {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|url = http://www.judybaca.com/artist/portfolio/the-great-wall|website = www.judybaca.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}</ref> and had provided over 400 people with employment and leadership development opportunities.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Learning Race and Ethnicity: Youth and Digital Media|last = Everett|first = Ana|publisher = The MIT Press|year = 2007|isbn = 0262550679|location = |pages = 89}}</ref> It’s interesting to note that although the original project called for a mural that represented a history of California from the days of the dinosaurs to the year 1910, Baca instead kept the project going, adding about 350 feet to the mural each year. Although the mural now measures 2,754 feet in length, the mural is not yet complete. The project is proposed to continue until the mural reaches about a mile in length so that it may portray not only contemporary times, but also a vision of the future.<ref name=\"sparcinla.org\"/>  ==Teaching career== Her first teaching job at her former high school, Alemany high school, was short lived as she was let go, due to being involved in public protests against the vietnam war. Baca began a professorship at [[University of California, Irvine]] in 1980, and left in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/3622/Judy-Baca.html |title=Judy Baca Biography - (b. 1946), Murals and SPARC, Works, Social and Public Art Resource Center |publisher=Jrank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}</ref> The next year, she implemented the Muralist Training Workshop to teach people the techniques she had picked up.<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.31\"/> She also served as a professor at [[California State University, Monterey Bay]] from 1994 to 1996, where she co-founded the Visual & Public Arts Institute Department. Judy Baca has been teaching art in the UC system for just over 28 years, 15 of those years have been at the UCLA Ceasar E. Chavez department of chicana/o studies. In 2002 she was joint appointed to the World's arts and culture department, and in 2014 she was appointed a full professor of the department.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Curriculum Vitae {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|url = http://www.judybaca.com/artist/curriculum-vitae/|website = www.judybaca.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}</ref>  In 1996 she moved to [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) and took on multiple roles. In 1993, she co-founded UCLA's [[Cesar E. Chavez|Cesar Chavez]] Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, an institution for which she serves as vice chair.  In 1998, she served as a master artist in residence with the Role of the Arts in Civic Dialogue at [[Harvard University]] <ref name=\"aztlanjournal.metapress.com\">http://aztlanjournal.metapress.com/media/49te8dtumq0yywh4uc5v/contributions/5/4/3/1/5431776771586217.pdf</ref>  === Workshops === Stockholm Conference: Community Mural Art and Social Change An international exploration of collective Mural Art as a tool to raise unheard voices.”  April 11, 2015  Judy Baca Leads Toronto Mural Workshop  April 10, 2015  Emancipation Workshop: April 10, 2015  http://www.judybaca.com/artist/workshops/judy-baca-leads-toronto-mural-workshop-2/  ===''The World Wall'' and other projects=== In 1987 she began painting ''The World Wall: A Vision of the Future Without Fear'', a painting that showed the world with no-violence. She believed the first step to world peace was imagining it, and she wanted artists from all over the world to help her paint it. She wanted it to be painted in panels so it could moved around to different places. After years of planning and contributions made by artists from other countries, the painting had its debut in [[Finland]] in 1990. The idea was that when the panels traveled around the world each host country would add their own panel to the collection. Some of the countries included [[Russia]], [[Israel]]/[[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Mexico]], and [[Canada]].<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.31-32</ref>  In 1988 [[Mayor of Los Angeles]] [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] commissioned her to create the Neighborhood Pride Program, a citywide project to paint murals. The project employed over 1,800 at-risk youth and has been responsible for the creation of over 105 murals throughout the city.  In 1996 she created ''La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra'' (\"Our Land Has Memory\") for the [[Denver International Airport]]. This one was personal for Baca, as her grandparents fled Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution]] and came to [[La Junta, Colorado]], [[Colorado]].<ref name=\"aztlanjournal.metapress.com\"/> The mural's intent was \"not only to tell the forgotten stories of people who, like birds or water, traveled back and forth across the land freely, before there was a line that distinguished which side you were from, but to speak to our shared human condition as temporary residents of the earth...The making of this work was an excavation of a remembering of their histories.\" It was completed in 2000.<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.34</ref>  She conducted research by interviewing residents and lead a workshop with [[Colorado State University–Pueblo|University of Southern Colorado]] students. She found a picture in a garage in [[Pueblo]] by Juan Espinosa, photographer and founder El Diario de la Gente, Boulder, Colorado, of an important meeting between [[Rodolfo Gonzales|Corky Gonzales]] of the Colorado Crusade for Justice and [[Cesar Chavez]] of the [[United Farm Workers]], and their agreement to bring the [[Delano grape strike]] to Colorado.<ref name=\"aztlanjournal.metapress.com\"/>  Judy spoke at the \"Against the Wall: The ruin and renewal of LA's murals\" panel held at Morono Kiang Gallery across the street from the famous \"Pope of Broadway\" mural. In that same year, she made the ''Cesar Chavez Monument Arch of Dignity, Equality, and Justice''. It is located at [[San Jose State University]]. It has a portrait of [[Cesar Chavez]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Dolores Huerta]].<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.35</ref>  == Recent and current projects == Judy Baca has not slowed down in recent years, she continues to be actively involved in her community, whether that be through her artwork, teaching, community projects, or holding workshops. In march 2010, Baca was part of a mural project in the east bay, Northern california, the richmond mural project. It is a five panel mural that featured different themes in each panel, the goal was to connect the citizens, and share their wildly diverse backgrounds. She was also part of a group that successfully preserved her mural, danza indigenas, in baldwin park, after there were violent protests and vandalism towards the artwork.  Baca has also had a huge part in the group, mural rescue program, which is a program that works to: restore, preserve/stabilize, and conserve murals (both painted and digital) that have been painted or printed on substrates and walls built in public environments. One of Baca's most recent and ongoing projects is “new codex-oaxaca- immigration and cultural memory” this project is about sharing artwork and stories of those who are immigrating from mexico (namely oaxaca) to the US; why are they immigrating, what are they leaving behind, what's happening to make them leave, etc. Baca is involved in choosing the art pieces that are being displayed, community outreach to help come up with ways for these immigrants to have a stable outcome, and just getting a conversation started in the community, using these immigrants artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Judy Baca News {{!}}  Judy Baca Artist|url = http://www.judybaca.com/artist/category/judy-baca-news/|website = www.judybaca.com|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}</ref>  ==Notable collections== *''[[Mi Abuelita]]'', 1970, [[Hollenbeck Park]], [[Los Angeles, California]]<ref name=\"Biography Today, pp.26-27\"/> *''[[Great Wall of Los Angeles]]'', 1976–present, Van Nuys, California *''[[History of Unitarianism]]'', 1981, [[First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles]], Los Angeles, California *''[[Danza Indigenas]]'', 1994, [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]], maintained by [[Amtrak]], [[Baldwin Park, California]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/about/art/locations/metrolink/ |title=Location &#124; Metrolink |publisher=Metro.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-25}}</ref> *''[[La Memoria de Nuestra Tierra: Colorado]]'', 2000, [[Denver International Airport]], [[Denver, Colorado]] *[[Digital tile murals]], 2000, City of Los Angeles, [[Venice Beach, California]] *''[[Migration of the Golden People]]'', 2002, Central American Research and Education Center of Los Angeles *''[[Cesar Chavez Monument Plaza]]'', 2008, [[San Jose State University]], [[San Jose, California]]<ref>\"Biography Today\", pp.37</ref> *''[[Danza de la Tierra]]'', 2009, Dallas Latino Cultural Center, [[Dallas, Texas]] *''[[Ataco, El Salvador Murals]]'', 2009 Invited by the US embassy, [[Ataco, El Salvador]] *''[[Tiny Ripples of Hope'' and ''Seeing Through Others Eyes]]'', 2010, Robert F.

According to Luna, one of her grandmothers was reportedly a former Irish actress who married a black interior decorator. Whether any of this background is true is uncertain.

She appeared in several movies produced by [[Andy Warhol]]. These included ''Screen Test: Donyale Luna'' (1964), in which critic [[Wayne Koestenbaum]] described Luna as \"pure diva, presenting a delicious mobile excess of mannerism\";<ref>{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_2_42/ai_109023349/pg_1 | work=ArtForum | title=\"Andy Warhol: Screen Tests\": Moma Qns, New York - Critical Essay | first=Wayne | last=Koestenbaum | year=2003}}</ref> ''Camp'' (1965), and ''Donyale Luna'' (1967), a 33-minute color film in which the model starred as [[Snow White]].  In the 1969 [[Federico Fellini]] film ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]'', she portrayed the witch Oenothea, \"who\", according to one commentator, \"in a trade-off with a wizard long ago ended up with fire between her legs. And it's real fire too, because Fellini shows us a scene in which a long line of foolish-looking peasants wait with unlit torches at Oenothea's bed.

In London's ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine|Sunday Times Magazine]]'', [[Harold Carlton]] hailed her as \"the completely New Image of the Negro woman. Fashion finds itself in an instrumental position for changing history, however slightly, for it is about to bring out into the open the veneration, the adoration, the idolization of the Negro\".<ref name=\"Stone\"/>   When Stone asked her about whether her appearances in Hollywood films would benefit the cause of black actresses, Luna answered, \"If it brings about more jobs for Mexicans, Asians, Native Americans, Africans, groovy. It could be good, it could be bad. I couldn't care less.\"<ref name=\"Stone\"/><ref name=\"cocoandcreme\"/>  ===Romantic relationships=== In the mid-1960s, Luna was married to an actor for 10 months.<ref name=\"Time\"/> Later she reportedly was engaged to the Austrian-born Swiss actor [[Maximilian Schell]], to an unnamed Danish photographer, and to [[Georg Willing]], a German actor who appeared in European horror films (such as 1970's ''Necropolis'') and with the [[Living Theatre]].<ref name=\"Stone\"/>  Around 1969 Luna was also romantically involved with German actor [[Klaus Kinski]]. They posed together in several photographs. The relationship ended when Kinski asked her entourage to leave his house in Rome: he was concerned that their drug use could damage his career.<ref>Christian David: ''Kinski: Die Biographie.''

It is the only [[world cup competition|world cup]] contested by teams representing entire [[continent]]s, rather than just those of individual [[nation]]s. The event takes place every four years.  The founder of the World Cup was the Italian IAAF former President [[Primo Nebiolo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/mini/centenary/News/NewsDetail.aspx?id=63195|title=Past Presidents of the IAAF|publisher=iaaf.org|accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref>  ==History== The previous format (known as the IAAF World Cup) included separate men's and women's competitions. Eight teams would take part in each event - five continental and three national. If the stadium had a ninth lane, the host nation could also enter a team. The winning men's and women's teams (and runners-up) from the preceding [[European Team Championships]] qualified as national teams for the World Cup, together with the [[USA Track & Field|United States]]. The continental teams comprised [[Confederation of African Athletics|Africa]], [[Asian Athletics Association|Asia]], [[Oceania Athletics Association|Oceania]], the rest of [[Americas|America]] ([[North American, Central American and Caribbean Athletic Association]] and [[CONSUDATLE|Confederación Sudamericana de Atletismo]]), and the rest of [[European Athletic Association|Europe]]. <!-- The intention was to link each national or continental team in the table to the relevant athletics association (or to the actual team, if there is an article). Some don't appear in the table, so they are linked in the introduction. Some teams in the table have not yet been linked to associations, so they still link to the nation or continent. The Pan-American team represents two associations, so these links are given in the introduction. -->  Beginning with the 2010 event in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Croatia]], the format was changed and the competition renamed the IAAF Continental Cup. The number of regional teams was reduced to four: [[Confederation of African Athletics|Africa]], [[Asian Athletics Association|Asia]]/[[Oceania Athletics Association|Pacific]], [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]], each represented by two athletes or one relay team in every event. National teams were eliminated from the competition. In addition, the separate men's and women's competitions were merged; the continental teams now compete for a single mixed championship.<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/aboutiaaf/news/newsid=48375.html IAAF Council Meeting notes, Monaco - 21 November].

The land was extensively covered with bush, with such plants as [[Acacia|wattle]], [[sheoak]] and other native species.<ref>Couper-Smartt ''op cit'' p 23</ref> The peninsula now has a wind swept feel due to the clearance of these plants.   The peninsula has strong maritime associations due to its proximity to Port Adelaide, the Port River and Outer Harbor. [[Collins class submarine]]s were built at the suburb of [[Osborne, South Australia|Osborne]]. Cement production also occurs on the peninsula at [[Birkenhead, South Australia|Birkenhead]]. In 1999, the [[Pelican Point Power Station]] was established at the northeastern tip of the peninsula adjacent to the Port River.<ref>[http://www.ipplc.com.au/Page.php?iPageID=33 Pelican Point Power Station], International Power plc Australia, 2007.</ref>  Lefevre Peninsula also contains several sailing clubs and golf clubs and the popular Semaphore Road foreshore and .

In 1886, historian William Smith Pelletreau published ''The History of Putnam County, New York''.  In his second chapter on the town of [[Southeast, New York|Southeast]], he wrote: \"The land now [1886] embraced within the limits of the village of Brewster consists of a farm which was sold by the commissioners of forfeiture to Peleg Bailey, in 1781.  A portion of it afterward passed into the possession of Bailey Howes, his grandson, who sold 98 acres to Gilbert Bailey, April 1st 1833.  Two other tracts containing 39 acres were sold to Gilbert Bailey, by William P. Downs and Frederick Parks in 1838.  On the 17th of February, 1848, Gilbert Bailey sold the whole tracts, estimated at 134 acres, to James and Walter F. Brewster, for the sum of $8,000.\"<ref name=\"Pelletreau\">The History of Putnam County, New York. 1886. Reprinted by the Landmarks Preservation Committee of the Southeast Museum, Brewster, New York 1975</ref>   \"At the time of the purchase, the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] was finished and trains were running as far as [[Croton Falls, New York|Croton Falls]].  The road was surveyed as far as [[Pawling (town), New York|Pawling]], and the prospect of its being continued to that point seemed certain, and to the new purchasers of the farm it seemed just the place for a station.\"<ref name=\"Pelletreau\" />  \"The New York and Harlem Railroad was finished to this place and the depot was built in that year, and what is now [1886] the Main street was opened, for the purpose of allowing the stages from [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] to come to the station.  Previous to this the firm of Crosby and DeForest had run a line of four horse stages to Croton Falls, from Danbury.  The first new house in the place was built by Walter F. Brewster, in 1850 and stood in front of the present [1886] Methodist church.\"<ref name=\"Pelletreau\" />  That house, now listed as the [[Walter Brewster House]] on the New York State and national historic registers, is owned by the [[Landmark Preservation Society of Southeast]].  \"The Harlem Railroad's extension of its mileage in 1849 proved advantageous to Mr. Brewster, who needed all sorts of materials in his building activities.  Large shipments were billed simply to 'Brewster's Station' for lack of better designation.  This is the apparent origin of the village's name, which many years ago was shortened to Brewster.\"<ref name=\"BTTY\" />  === Post offices === Jonathan F. Frost was the first Postmaster of the Brewster's Station post office, which operated from October 25, 1850 through April 28, 1883.<ref name=\"PostalHistory\">''New York Postal History: The Post Offices and First Postmaster from 1775 to 1980'' by John L. Kay and Chester M. Smith, Jr., American Philatelic Society, 1982</ref>  During this period in American history, post offices were frequently located in the stores or businesses owned by the individuals who served as postmasters.  This held true in the village of Brewster for the next century.  In 1863 the Brewster Station post office relocated to the A.F. Lobdell General Store, across from the railroad station, the present location of the Avery Building at 12-18 Main Street.  Alexander F. Lobdell, the store's proprietor, was appointed postmaster by President Abraham Lincoln and was reappointed by Presidents Grant, Hayes, Garfield and Arthur, continuing as Brewster's postmaster until 1887.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\">The Town of Southeast  1788-1988   Edited by Suzanne F. Truran, John J. Dunford, Priscilla A. Truran  - Pub. by the Town of Southeast, 1990</ref>  The Brewster post office began operation on April 28, 1883, removing the word \"Station\" in its identity and postmarks.<ref name=\"PostalHistory\" />  In 1887, the post office relocated to the Brewster Standard building, the present location of the Sprague Building at 31 Main Street.  In 1886, Emerson W. Addis, publisher of the ''Brewster Standard'' weekly newspaper, became the postmaster and held that position until 1916.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\" />  In 1916, the post office moved to new quarters on Park Street, between Main Street and Marvin Avenue, into the Rundall Building, and John Thorp became the new postmaster.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\" />  In 1923, Ralph Diehl, proprietor of the Brewster Bakery, became postmaster, and the post office was moved to his baking plant on Progress Street in 1927.  Howard Tuttle later became the postmaster, holding the position until 1934 when Seth Howes was appointed.  In 1936, the post office relocated to the building now occupied by the Eagle Eye Thrift Shop at 65 Main Street.  Mr. Howes held the office until 1958 when John F. Larkin, Jr. was made acting postmaster.  He was later promoted to the full title of postmaster.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\" />  On July 17, 1966, the post office relocated to a new brick building on Main Street, where it remained for the next three decades. Mr. Larkin retired in 1972 and was succeeded by Earl Tuttle, who became the last Southeast resident to hold the position of postmaster since that time. Mr. Tuttle retired in 1985.<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\" />  The new facility was the first Brewster post office to occupy a space that was specifically designed for the purpose, rather than being retrofitted from some previous use.  It had a separate lobby to house post office boxes, a loading dock at the rear of the building and a postal inspector's separate entrance and hallway with one-way glass for observing postal workers and the public.  In the mid-1990s, the Main Street facility closed and a new post office opened at its present location at 3 Mount Ebo Road North outside the village limits in the town of Southeast.  Although the new facility is more than {{convert|3|mi|0}} from the center of Brewster, it still retains the designation and postmark \"Brewster 10509\".  === \"Brewster\" vs. \"Southeast\" === [[File:Brewster NY from Metro North.JPG|thumb|View of village from train station]] The town of [[Southeast, New York|Southeast]] contains the village of Brewster, though each of those municipalities have independent governments, separate highway departments and separate courts, although the government of the Town of Southeast has jurisdiction over Brewster. In common usage, though technically incorrect, \"Brewster\" refers to the entire town, rather than just the village.  The railroad station in downtown Brewster, owned in turn by the [[New York Central]], [[Conrail]], [[Penn Central]] and now [[Metro-North Railroad]], has always been known as \"Brewster\" because it is located in the village of Brewster.  Since 1849, rail customers coming to Southeast only knew they were travelling to \"Brewster\".  Over time, the name Southeast was all but forgotten.  The new depot that was built in Southeast, just a quarter mile north of the village, was first named \"Brewster North\".  That second depot has since been renamed \"Southeast\".  Before 1962, there were several local post offices throughout the town of Southeast, located near larger concentrations of residences and businesses.  The last of these, Southeast's Putnam Lake post office, closed in 1968.<ref name=\"PostalHistory\" /> When a new post office opened at 16 Main Street in Brewster on July 17, 1966,<ref name=\"1988Yearbook\"/> even before [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] and [[Interstate 684]] were constructed, it was named Brewster and given the zip code 10509.<ref name=\"PostalHistory\" />   The two highways brought massive population increases, nearly tripling the number of residents in Southeast in a matter of about 20 years.  As a result, \"Brewster, NY 10509\" was part of the return address of every resident of Southeast and Brewster. Probably because of the proximity to the Brewster train station, the highway exit signs of I-84 and I-684 say \"Brewster\". Road signs in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[Carmel, New York|Carmel]] and other nearby towns all direct travelers to Brewster.  Only the town's \"Welcome to Southeast\" signs acknowledge the town's existence.    The post office has relocated out of the village and removed \"Brewster\" from the building. The ZIP code is still 10509 but does not have the name of the municipality on its exterior of the building. Residents who live in the town still use \"Brewster 10509\" for their return address, and the post office still uses \"Brewster\" rather than \"Southeast\" in its postmarks.  ==Geography== [[File:Chondrodite-Magnetite-37952.jpg|thumb|Red [[chondrodite]] and black [[magnetite]] from the old [[Tilly Foster Mine]] in Brewster]] Brewster is located along the [[East Branch Croton River|East Branch]] of the [[Croton River]] at {{Coord|41|23|46|N|73|36|57|W|type:city}} (41.396050, -73.615954),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> near the center of the town of Southeast.

The dome, horizontal or tilted, is filled with real-time (interactive) or pre-rendered (linear) [[computer animation]]s, live capture images, or [[compositing|composited]] environments.  Although the current technology emerged in the early-to-mid 1990s, fulldome environments have evolved from numerous influences, including immersive art and storytelling, with technological roots in [[dome|domed architecture]], [[planetarium]]s, multi-projector film environments, [[flight simulation]], and [[virtual reality]].  Initial approaches to moving fulldome imagery used wide-angle lenses, both [[35 mm film|35]] and [[70 mm film]], but the expense and ungainly nature of the film medium prevented much progress; furthermore, film formats such as [[Omnimax]] did not cover the full two [[pi]] [[steradian]]s of the dome surface, leaving a section of the dome blank (though, due to seating arrangements, that part of the dome was not seen by most viewers). Later approaches to fulldome utilized monochromatic [[vector graphics|vector graphics systems]] projected through a [[fisheye lens]]. Contemporary configurations employ raster [[video projectors]], either singly or grouped together to cover the dome surface with full-color images and animations.  == Video technology ==  Fulldome video projection can use a variety of technologies in two typical formats: single- and multiple-projector systems. The individual projector(s) can be driven by a variety of video sources, typically feeding material rendered in either real-time or “pre-rendered” modes. The end result is a video image that covers an entire domed projection surface, yielding an immersive experience that fills a viewer’s field of view.  === Single- versus multiple-projector systems ===  Single-projector fulldome video systems use a single (or mixed) video source displayed through a single fisheye lens, typically located at or near the center of a hemispherical projection surface. A single projector has the benefit of avoiding edge blends (see below) between multiple projectors. The main disadvantage of single fisheye systems is that they are limited to the resolution of one projector, and in the smallest dimension of the video image to cover a full dome.  Another disadvantage of central projectors is the loss of the center of the dome for optimal viewing of the reconstructed perspective view provided by true hemispheric projection, a problem shared with traditional planetarium projectors.  However, this disadvantage fades as audience size increases (everyone cannot be at the center of the dome anyway).  Single-projector mirror systems, pioneered by Mirrordome from Swinburne, but now offered by a plethora of manufacturers, are placed on the edge of the dome to increase seating, decrease costs, and to allow analog planetariums to become digital without giving up their star projector.  It is also possible to build such a system at relatively low cost.  The main disadvantage is noticeably lower projection quality compared to purpose built lenses, despite being able to project a higher proportion of the projector resolution.  Multiple-projector fulldome video systems rely on two or more video projectors edge-blended to create a seamless image that covers a hemispherical projection surface; splitting the entire image up into segments allows for higher-resolution imagery and projector placement that does not intrude on the viewing area underneath the dome. A disadvantage of multiple projection is the need to frequently adjust the alignment of projectors and the uneven aging of separate projectors leading to brightness and color differences between segments. Even minor performance differences between projectors can be obvious when projecting a solid color across the entire scene.  Edge blended areas where projectors overlap often have some smearing, double images, and can have very obvious additive black level areas if poorly designed or configured.  === Common video projector technology ===  A wide variety of video projection technologies has been employed in domes, including [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP), [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD), [[liquid crystal on silicon]] (LCOS), and most recently, two varieties of laser projectors (see the [[laser video projector]]).  For multi-projector systems in particular, display devices must have a low [[black level]] (i.e., project little or no light when no signal is sent to them) to allow for reasonable edge-blending between the different projector footprints. Otherwise, overlapping video images will have an additive effect, causing a complex pattern of grey to appear even when no image is being projected. This becomes particularly important for users in the [[planetarium]] field, who have a vested interest in projecting a dark night sky. The desire for projectors to “go to black” has resulted in continued use of CRT technology, even as newer and less expensive technologies have emerged.  LCD projectors have fundamental limits on their ability to project true black as well as light, which has tended to limit their use in planetariums. LCOS and modified LCOS projectors have improved on LCD [[contrast ratio]]s while also eliminating the “screen door” effect of small gaps between LCD pixels. “Dark chip” DLP projectors improve on the standard DLP design and can offer relatively inexpensive solution with bright images, but the black level requires physical baffling of the projectors. As the technology matures and reduces in price, laser projection looks promising for dome projection as it offers bright images, large dynamic range and a very wide [[color space]].  DOME lenses and standard lens are similar in some ways. They both depend on the type of display device, LCD, DLP, LCOS, DILA and the size chip or panel that is part of this device. The unique feature of the DOME lens is the actual shape of the glass, the projected image spill out from the top and all around circumference of the lens. The biggest advantage is how this type of lens maintains focus over the full 180 x 180 field of view. A single standard flat field or curved field lens would have major focus and distortion issue. Several lens developers offer DOME lenses with each designed to a specific projector class and display device. These lenses can cover a variety of pixel sizes and display resolutions.  === Types of content ===  Computer Generated (CG) content is the main source of material for Fulldome.  CG content can be live simulator output, such as from planetarium simulation software, or prerecorded fulldome video.  [[Live-Action FullDome]] videos are becoming more available for dome use as digital video camera resolutions increase.  ==History== {{external links|section|date=July 2015}} {| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"4\" cellpadding=\"5\" |- valign=\"top\" | 1983 || First [[Evans & Sutherland]] Digistar I calligraphic scan (projection of light points and lines - also known as vector scan) planetarium projector at the [[Science Museum of Virginia]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], U.S.A. |- valign=\"top\" | 1992 || First dome-based vector/calligraphic scan scientific visualization system at [[SIGGRAPH]], installed by the [[North Carolina Supercomputing Center]] using a reprogrammed Digistar I for molecular visualization |- valign=\"top\" | 1994 || [[Alternate Realities Corporation]] premieres their first [[VisionDome]] prototype at [[Glaxo]] Inc. in [[Research Triangle Park, North Carolina]], U.S.A.

The United States team's 4–3 win over the Soviet team, which came into the 1980 Games having won 4 consecutive Olympic gold medals, became known as the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" in the US press. The win captured the hearts of Americans during a time of Cold War tensions, even though it was the win against [[Finland]] that captured the gold medal. (The Soviet team ultimately won the silver medal.) *[[Eric Heiden]] of the United States won gold in the 500m, 1000m, 1500m, 5000m, and 10,000m [[Speed skating at the 1980 Winter Olympics|speedskating]] events, setting 4 Olympic records and 1 world record (10,000m) in the process and delivering 83% of the American gold medals (the only other gold, as noted above, was won by the hockey team). Heiden became the first to ever win all five speed skating events and is still the [[List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games|only athlete to win 5 gold medals at one Winter Games]].  * [[Sweden]]'s [[Ingemar Stenmark]] won both the giant slalom and the slalom. * [[Hanni Wenzel]] won the women's giant slalom and slalom, making [[Liechtenstein]] the smallest country to produce an Olympic champion. * [[Ulrich Wehling]] of [[East Germany]] and [[Irina Rodnina]] of the [[USSR at the Winter Olympics|USSR]] won their respective events for the third time, Wehling in [[Nordic combined]] and Rodnina in [[pair skating|pairs figure skating]]. * [[Aleksandr Tikhonov]] of the [[USSR at the Winter Olympics|USSR]] earned his fourth straight gold medal as part of the 4 x 7.5m [[biathlon]] relay team. * [[Nikolay Zimyatov]] of the [[USSR at the Winter Olympics|USSR]] earned three gold medals in cross-country skiing. * [[Robin Cousins]] won gold for Great Britain in the men's singles figure skating. * East Germany won the most medals overall (23) but had fewer golds (9) than the USSR (10). * In possibly the most dramatic duel of the games, [[Sweden]]'s [[Thomas Wassberg]] edged [[Finland]]'s [[Juha Mieto]] in the 15&nbsp;km cross-country skiing by 0.01 seconds, the closest margin of victory ever in Olympic [[Cross-country skiing at the 1980 Winter Olympics|cross-country skiing]]. This led the [[International Ski Federation]] (ISF) to time all events to the nearest 1/10 second in the future.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} * Although they did not get any medals, the People's Republic of China entered the Olympics Games for the first time after the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] agreed to designate the [[Republic of China]] \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\". * Lake Placid 1980 marked the first use of artificial snow in Olympic competition. * Lake Placid 1980 was the last Olympics to be opened by the [[Vice President of the United States]], as 1980 was a Presidential election year.  == Sports == [[Image:Lake Placid - Cauldron.jpg|thumb|The Olympic cauldron]] [[File:Lake Placid - Ski jumps.jpg|thumb|The [[Lake Placid Olympic Ski Jumping Complex|Ski Jumping Complex]].]] There were 38 events contested in 6 sports (10 disciplines).

[[Cyprus]] made their Olympic debut at the 1980 Winter Olympics. The People's Republic of China and [[Costa Rica]] both made their Winter Olympic debut.

What remains of the conduit flows beside [[Trumpington Street]] and past Brookside, where it is at its widest.

The conduit currently ends at [[Silver Street, Cambridge|Silver Street]].  The scheme was first devised in 1574 by [[Andrew Perne]], Master of Peterhouse, who proposed that a stream be diverted from Nine Wells through the town and the King's Ditch to improve sanitation.  The design was revived by [[James Montague (bishop)|James Montagu]], Master of [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex College]] and built at the expense of the [[University of Cambridge|University]] and town.<ref name=\"obelisk\">Inscription on the monument at Nine Wells</ref> Although Thomas Hobson was just only one of those involved in the construction he endowed a Hobson's Conduit Trust to deal with maintenance of the waterway, which still exists today. The new river was dug from Vicar's Brook near Long Road to the conduit head at the end of Lensfield Road as a joint venture between the University and the city. Here the flow of water was divided into four separate branches for different uses.<ref>{{cite book|isbn=9781108042444|url=http://books.google.com/?id=dOpvwkneet8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:9781108042444#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Hobson's Conduit|author1=Bushell|first1=W.

Following a fire in 1849, the [[Market Square, Cambridge|Market Square]] was redeveloped and in 1855 a [[Gothic Revival]] gabled fountain was erected (marked on many contemporary maps as \"lavatory\" as there were underground public conveniences here) and the original structure of Hobson's Conduit was moved. Most of the fountain was pulled down in 1953.

In his youth Ibn Ḥabib studied the Talmud under rabbi [[Samuel Valensi]].  == ''Ein Yaakov'' == In 1492, when the Jews were [[Spanish expulsion|expelled from Spain]], he settled at [[Salonica]], where he wrote his ''[[Ein Yaakov]]'' in the house of Don Judah [[Benveniste]] grandson of Don Abraham Benveniste, who placed his rich library at his disposal. Ibn Ḥabib also availed himself of the library of Don Shemuel Benveniste the brother of Judah, which contained, among other great works, a large collection of novellæ on the Talmud by many distinguished commentators. By the aid of the works from these two libraries Ibn Ḥabib collected all the [[aggadah|haggadic]] passages from the [[Babylonian Talmud]], and many from the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. The publication of this work began in 1516 in the printing establishment of Judah Gedaliah, the author himself carefully reading the proof-sheets; but he died at Salonica just as the first two orders ([[Zeraim]] and [[Moed]]) came from the press. His son, R. Levi, completed the labors of his father, but the work appeared before the public without the notes of the author to the last four orders (\"sedarim\"), and without the index, which the author originally intended to cover the entire work. The [[aggadah|haggadot]] of the Jerusalem Talmud are also lacking.  The ''Ein Yaakov'' is the only work Ibn Ḥabib left to the world. The object of the author was to familiarize the public with the ethical spirit of Talmudic literature; at the same time his notes were intended to refute the charges brought against the Talmud by the numerous Spanish converts. The book, which thus appealed to the mass of the unlearned, became very popular. It was often edited and annotated, and served as a text-book of religious instruction. There are over thirty editions known; the latest ([[Vilnius|Vilna]], 1883) contains twenty commentaries, among them one which consists of selections from more than one hundred homiletic works. Of the additions, the most important one is that of [[Leon of Modena|Leone di Modena]], under the title ''Ha-Boneh,'' which has appeared in all editions since 1684. The author's intention was chiefly to propagate a more rationalistic view of the Talmudic [[Aggadah|Haggadah]]. In some editions the title of the whole work is ''Ein Yisrael.''  == References == * {{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=H&artid=16|article=Habib, Jacob (ben Solomon) ibn}}  ;Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography * Besides the bibliographical works s.v., see the introduction of the author and the various commentators in the Wilna edition of 1883 * [[Zunz]], G.

He held the position of notary while serving the council and was also appointed curator of the estates of minors and interstate estates for the viceroyalty of Mexico.  In 1802, he was recalled from the council to become [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]]'s private secretary.  As such, he was sent to represent the king at the 1804 coronation of [[Napoleon]].  His position allowed him to make a tour through western and central Europe.  Velázquez resigned his post after Charles IV was forced to abdicate and later imprisoned by Napoleon in 1809.  After receiving news of Hidalgo's Mexican independence movement, he made arrangements to return to Mexico.  Velazquez was unwilling to identify with either of the contending parties and thus resolved to settle in New York, where his scholarly career began.  ==Language Contributions== Once in [[New York]], Velazquez devoted himself to one of his greatest passions—language.  He taught Spanish and founded a collegiate institute where many young Latin American men were educated.  Velázquez also joined the esteemed professors of [[Columbia University]] to teach [[Spanish language|Castilian]] language and literature.  Aside from teaching, he was a member of learned societies in Europe and the United States and author of Spanish school-books and Spanish-English language [[Bilingual dictionary|dictionaries]].  Some of his English, Spanish, and German works include: ''Dufief's, Ellendorff's New Method'', ''An Easy Introduction to Spanish Conversation'', ''New Spanish Reader'', ''A New Method of Learning to Read, Write, and Speak the Spanish Language'', ''Elementos de la lengua castellana fundados en los principios establecidos por la academia española y en el uso de los autores clásicos'', and ''Spanisches Lesebuch: Enthaltend ausgewählte Stücke aus Spanischen Musterschriftststellern in gebundener und ungebundener Rede''.  ==Legacy== In 1852, Velázquez used [[Dr. Don Mateo Seoane]]'s edition of the revered [[Neumon and Baretti Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages]] as a basis for his version, A Pronouncing Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages. Velázquez's dictionary became the preeminent authority in Spanish-English dictionaries, giving editors and publishers the model for Spanish-English dictionaries. Edward Gray revised the first edition, creating A New Pronouncing Dictionary of the Spanish and English Languages almost a half century later.  Several revisions have been made to Velazquez's first edition, the most recent by [[Velázquez Press]] in 2003, helping it remain a venerable dictionary throughout the world.  ==References== {{reflist}}  ==External links== * [http://www.velazquezpress.com Velázquez Spanish-English Dictionary] - Velázquez Press * [http://archive.org/details/anewpronouncing00iribgoog A new pronouncing dictionary of the Spanish and English languages (1900)] - Archive.Org * [http://archive.org/details/anewspanishread00cadegoog A New Spanish Reader ...

A person from Oliveira can be called \"Oliveirense\".  ==History== Oliveira's history begins around the middle of the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fonseca |first=Luiz Gonzaga da |date=1961 |title=História de Oliveira |location=Oliveira }}</ref> Portuguese travellers used to stop in Oliveira's region, when travelling towards [[Goiás]], through the \"Picada de Goiás\" or \"Caminho de Goiás\" (Path of Goiás). From this small village emerged the city. It used to have considerable political importance and regional hegemony during the [[Empire of Brazil|Brazilian Empire]].  Some stories say that a disease outbreak in the region of [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]] was also responsible for a great migration to Oliveira. The village of Oliveira used to belong to the village of [[Tiradentes, Minas Gerais|São José do Rio das Mortes]], which is the current [[Tiradentes, Minas Gerais|Tiradentes (Minas Gerais)]], and it already possessed a chapel in 1758. The village was raised to the title of [[parish]] on July 14, 1832, and then raised to a town, on March 16, 1839 by the provincial law nº 134. Finally, it was lifted to the title of city on September 19, 1861. Differently than other cities in the same region, such as [[Ouro Preto]] and [[São João Del Rei]], Oliveira did not emerge due to the exploration of gold and diamond, instead, the development of livestock and agriculture activities were the main reasons. Such activities began with the [[Bandeirantes]] that started to migrate from [[São Paulo]] to the countryside of [[Minas Gerais]]. During the transition from village to city, the municipality had always stood as a strategic place for goods exchange and capital flow, as it was an important path for travellers. Therefore, all these reasons were responsible for the rapidly growth of the municipality at that time. After the end of [[slavery in Brazil]], the Brazilian government stimulated the immigration. Oliveira received Syrian and Lebanese settlers, who managed the commerce activities. Moreover, the city had a very strong Portuguese influence, mainly in architecture.  There are two versions about the origin of the Oliveira's name. There are stories that the first inhabitants of the region found some olive trees. Therefore, they named the place \"Oliveiras\" that later would be simplified to Oliveira. However, there is a rumor that a portuguese woman, called Dona Maria de Oliveira, used to live in the region during the second half of the 18th century. She used to live in a house in the region where Oliveira currently exists, when the first [[Bandeirantes]] started to travel towards [[Goiás]]. Therefore, Oliveira was named because of her surname.  In the beginning of the 20th century, the city became around the world, as it was the birth place of the famous scientist [[Carlos Chagas]]. He discovered the [[Chagas disease]] and he was the pioneer in the research of diseases caused by protozoa. He was also indicated to the [[Nobel Prize]] in the beginning of the 20th century in [[Germany]].  == Geography == Oliveira is located at [[latitude]] 20º41'45\" south and [[longitude]] 44º49'37\" west. It is located at the mesoregion called Campos das Vertentes and the average altitude is 982 meters. Politically, it is part of the West of the state of Minas Gerais, even though it is geographically located at the southwest of the state. The estimated population in 2006 was 40,966 according to the PNUD, and 41,181 in 2013 according to IBGE. Besides the main city, Oliveira also possess the district of Morro do Ferro, which consists on an approximate population of 1,500 inhabitants. Morro do Ferro is located at 35 kilometers from Oliveira's city centre. The whole municipality's area is 896,494&nbsp;km².  Oliveira is the sixth most populous city in the West of Minas Gerais. It is the 80º most populous city of the state and 289º most populous city amos the Southeast of [[Brazil]]. It is currently attempting to become an important industrial hub.  Oliveira is locate near the main urban agglomeration of the southeast of [[Brazil]] and the other important cities of the state of [[Minas Gerais]].

Oliveira technically belongs to the Platina basin. The main rivers that supply water to the city are Lambari river and Jacaré river, which is an affluent of Grande river.  === Topography and Vegetation === Oliveira's territory is situated in a region that can be considered as an extension of the [[Mantiqueira Mountains]]. The city is located on a set of  hills at an average altitude of 1000 meters above sea level. The topography is divided in:  Topography (%) Plain: 5 undulating: 70 Mountainous: 25 Maximum altitude: 1209 meters Minimum altitude: 910 meters  Oliveira's vegetation is composed predominantly by [[Cerrado]] and [[Temperate Grasslands]]. Temperate Grasslands are mainly consisted of grasses and can be found in the higher altitudes of Oliveira.  == Infrastructure == [[File:Oliveira Longe.JPG|thumb|500px|City's Centre.]] [[File:Boulevard Oliveira.jpg|thumb|300px|Boulevard Jacéa Abi-Ackel.]]  Oliveira is known for having a excellent urban infrastructure. It has the greatest First Aid Post (Emergency Department) of the Middle-West of Minas Gerais, which has been opened. Oliveira's architecture has a clearly Iberian Influence and it is visibly the most european-like city in the region. Such architecture is highly expressed in the great 19th-century mansions, statues, monuments spread along the city. Its squares and avenues are well decorated and its buildings are remarkable, such as Our Lady of Oliveira Cathedral (Catedral de Nossa Senhora de Oliveira), which is based on Roman [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] style and the old Matriz Church built in [[baroque]] style during the 18th century. Furthermore, there are several modern buildings in the city.  === Highways === Oliveira is located at a strategic place and it is crossed by three important federal and state highways:  * [[BR-494]] * [[BR-369]] * [[BR-381]]  === Railroads === [[File:Ferrovia Oliveira.jpg|thumb|450px|Centro-Atlantic Railroad passing through the city.]] The Centro-Atlantic Railroad (Ferrovia Centro-Atlântica) passes through Oliveira and links interior areas of Brazil to the coast.  === Airport === Oliveira has an airport, which runway is 1,180 meters length and 20 meters width. It can receive small and middle sized airplanes. There is also a terminal for boarding and arrivals.  == Subdivisions == [[File:Bairro Acácio Ribeiro.jpg|thumb|right|420px|Adicionar legenda aqui|Acácio Ribeiro Neighborhood, traditional middle class neighborhood]] [[File:Bairro Sinhaninha.jpg|thumb|300px|Dona Sinhaninha Neighborhood, middle class area]] Oliveira's urban area can be divided into 51 neighborhoods, where there are more than 550 streets.

It is happening earlier and in a faster rate than it has been predicted for Brazilian Population in general. There are several reasons for this fact, but it can mainly attributed to the small birth and death rates in the city. According to the IBGE's census,<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://cidades.ibge.gov.br/painel/populacao.php?lang=&codmun=314560&search=minas-gerais{{!}}oliveira{{!}}infograficos:-evolucao-populacional-e-piramide-etaria |title=Infográficos: Evolução populacional e pirâmide etária |publisher= [[IBGE]] |date=2010 |accessdate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> Oliveira's population presents a faster aging process than the average of the state of Minas Gerais and the rest of the country.  == Economy ==  Oliveira's economy is mainly based on services sector (Tertiary sector). In the industrial sector (Secondary), two main industries can be highlighted: Baptista de Almeida (Candy and Caramel Factory Santa Rita) and Kromberg & Schubert (a German multinational company). The GDP division per economy sectors show that half of Gross Domestic Product is generated by services sector. Industry comprises around a third of the city's economy, while the primary sector is only responsible by 17% of the city's economy. [[File:princesa do oeste.jpg|thumb|left|780px|The main economic activity of the municipality is based on the tertiary sector. In the past few decades, there has been an effort to become industrial centre.]]  ;GDP division by sectors: * Primary (agriculture and livestock farming): 17% * Secondary (Industry): 33% * Tertiary (Services): 50%  Between 2005 and 2012, Oliveira has had a astronomic economic and social growth. The urban structure and modernization can also be highlighted. In a recent study that has mapped the misery concentration in [[Brazil]], it could be seen that the proportion of people that could be considered miserable in Oliveira is not even 1.5%, which is far lower than the national average that is 8.5% of the entire population. Oliveira is also located in a very dynamic and richest region in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. Furthermore, Oliveira is placed in the top average monthly income per capita when compared with the surrounding municipalities. The following table show this information:  {| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:left;\" |+ '''Average Monthly Income per capita <ref name=\"est\">{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/especiais/mapa-da-miseria-e-da-desigualdade-economica-no-brasil,141007.htm |title=Mapa da miséria e da desigualdade econômica no Brasil - |publisher= [[O Estado de S.

As Oliveira's history is highly based on the Iberian culture brought by its Portuguese settlers, Roman Catholicism is predominant in the city. However, other religions with less number of followers are also present in the city.  === Catholicism ===  According to IBGE's<ref name=\"oliveira1\">{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.cidades.ibge.gov.br/xtras/temas.php?lang=&codmun=314560&idtema=91&search=minas-gerais|title=Resultados da Amostra por Religião em Oliveira |publisher= [[IBGE]]|date=2010 |accessdate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> census in 2010, there are 34,938 catholics in Oliveira, which is aroung 84% of the population.  As said before, a traditional Oliveirense is a religious person. Roman Catholicism was brought by Portuguese settlers and it is still predominant in the city. This tradition led to the creation of the Diocese of Oliveira in 1941.  The Diocese of Oliveira was created in December 20, 1941, by Pope Pius XII (Bula Quo uberiores fructus), as a result of the dismemberment of [[Belo Horizonte]]'s Archdiocese. The diocese is located in the mid-south region of the state of [[Minas Gerais]] bordering the dioceses of [[Campanha]], [[Divinópolis]], [[Luz]] and [[São João del Rei]] and the archdioceses of [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]]. The entire territory is almost 8.000&nbsp;km² with a population of 300 thousand believers. In total, there are 28 parishes distributed in Oliveira's surroundings municipalities: [[Aguanil]], [[Bom Sucesso, Minas Gerais|Bom Sucesso]], [[Campo Belo]], [[Cana Verde]], [[Candeias]], [[Carmo da Mata]], [[Carmópolis de Minas]], [[Cristais]], [[Desterro de Entre Rios]], [[Itaguara]], Oliveira, [[Passa Tempo]], [[Perdões]], [[Piracema]], [[Ribeirão Vermelho]], [[Santana do Jacaré]], [[Santo Antônio do Amparo]], [[São Francisco de Paula, Minas Gerais|São Francisco de Paula]] and [[São Tiago]].  === Other Religions ===  Although most of Oliveira's population is catholic, there are other religions with less number of believers. According to IBGE's<ref name=\"oliveira1\"/> census in 2010, other religious such as Kardecists, Evangelicals also have considerable number of believers. People without any religion can also be found in the city. The following list summarizes the number of believers in some minor religions in the city:  ;Minor Religions: * Evangelicals: 3,373 * Kardecists: 398 * No Religion: 324 (62 atheists) * Jehovah's Witnesses: 179 * Buddhism: 22 * Umbanda e Candomblé: 13  ==Administration==  The current administration of the municipality can be seen in the list below: * [[Mayor]]: João da Batista de Sousa (2013/2016) * [[Deputy Mayor]]: Salatiel Alvim Lobato * President of the City Council Chamber: Leonardo Ananias Leão * Deputy President of the City Council Chamber: Francisco José Ribeiro Filho  ==Culture== [[File:Cai'náguas.jpg|thumb|left|300px|\"Cainágua\", centennial tradition in Oliveira's Carnaval.]]  The most famous cultural manifestation in the city is the [[Carnival]](Carnaval Party). Oliveira's Carnaval is one of the most famous in Minas Gerais. The main figure of the city's Carnaval is the \"Cainágua\", which literally means \"fall into the water\" or someone who falls into the water. It is said that the \"Caináguas\" are an adaption of the masked figures in [[Carnival of Venice|Venice's Carnaval]]. In Oliveira, the \"Caináguas\" were created from old roleplays where people wore masks to become unrecognizable during the party, so it would allow the party goers to get in touch with any other kind of people.  Another important feature of Oliveira's Carnaval is the group \"Pelo amor de Deus\", which literally means \"For God's sake\". The group was created by José Alberto Machado da Silva, followed by Maurício Almeida. The group usually party in Oliveira's city centre in the friday night during Carnaval celebrations. Each \"folião\" (Carnaval goer) dresses a different costume to party with the group.  The municipality has a strong cultural identity, which was constantly built over two centuries of existence. It was largely influenced by Portuguese culture and other people that immigrated to Brazil. Those people built a series of cultural events in the city. Therefore, the Carnaval party, the Holy Week and the Congado are some of this events throughout the year.  == Tourism == [[File:Vellha Matriz.jpg|thumb||300px|Matriz Church in [[Baroque]] style built by the Portuguese settlers in the XVIII century. One of the few ones to possess two circular steeples.]]  The main touristic attractions in Oliveira are: * A Grande Estátua do Cristo Redentor (Big Statue of Christ Redempteur) * Casa de Cultura Carlos Chagas (Carlos Chagas Culture House) * Antiga Igreja Matriz (Matriz Church, which was built in Baroque style)  The urban aspect of Oliveira is very traditional and impress visitors. For instance, the Boulevard that  surrounds the city, the gardens and the plazas. Recently, the main city centre has been protected by the Instituto Estadual do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico de Minas Gerais (IEPHA/MG). The main city centre still maintain several buildings from the XIX century, most of them in good conservation state.  == Famous Oliveirenses ==  * [[Áureo Ameno]] * [[Carlos Chagas]] * [[Eliseu Resende]] * [[Emílio Haddad Filho]] * [[Fernando Mitre]] * [[José Maria Pinto (político de Minas Gerais)|José Maria Pinto]] * [[José Oiticica]] * [[Maurício Chagas Bicalho]] * [[Nelson Ferreira Leite]] * [[Olavo Romano]] * [[Paulo Pinheiro Chagas]] * [[Paulo Roberto Haddad]] * [[Silvio Carvalho Mitre]] * [[Werley Ananias da Silva]] * [[Gabriel de Andrade Janot Pacheco]]  ==References==  <references/>  [[Category:Populated places in Minas Gerais]]</td></tr><tr><td>Thondavada</td><td>9143124</td><td>682889642</td><td>2015-09-26T19:43:27.000+0000</td><td>KylieTastic</td><td>2790592</td><td>{{Infobox settlement | name                    = Thondavada | native_name             =  | native_name_lang        =  | other_name              =  | nickname                =  | settlement_type         = village | image_skyline           =  | image_alt               =  | image_caption           =  | pushpin_map             = <!--India Andhra Pradesh--> | pushpin_label_position  = right | pushpin_map_alt         =  | pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Andhra Pradesh, India | latd                    =  | latm                    =  | lats                    =  | latNS                   = N | longd                   =  | longm                   =  | longs                   =  | longEW                  = E | coordinates_display     = inline,title | subdivision_type        = Country | subdivision_name        = [[India]] | subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]] | subdivision_name1       = [[Andhra Pradesh]] | subdivision_type2       = [[District]] | subdivision_name2       = [[Chittoor]] | subdivision_type3       = [[Mandal]] | subdivision_name3       = [[Chandragiri]] | established_title       = <!-- Established --> | established_date        =  | founder                 =  | named_for               =  | government_type         =  | governing_body          =  | unit_pref               = Metric | area_footnotes          =  | area_rank               =  | area_total_km2          =  | elevation_footnotes     =  | elevation_m             =  | population_total        =  | population_as_of        =  | population_rank         =  | population_density_km2  = auto | population_demonym      =  | population_footnotes    =  | demographics_type1      = Telugu | demographics1_title1    = Official | demographics1_info1     = [[Telugu language|Telugu]] | timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]] | utc_offset1             = +5:30 | postal_code_type        = ZIP Code | postal_code             = 517505 | registration_plate      =  | website                 =  | footnotes               =  }}  '''Thondavada''' is an historical village in [[Chandragiri]] mandal of [[Chittoor district]], [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]]. This village was at the headwaters of the Swarnamuki River. It is 10&nbsp;km from [[Tirumala - Tirupati|Tirupati]] and is home to a major temple for [[Lord Siva]] called Agastheeswara (MUKKOTI). Population of the village is more than 2500 people. Seasonal crops like [[sugar cane]], [[rice|paddy]] and [[mangoes]] are cultivated around the village.  ==Village representatives== * Current MP : Naramalli Sivaprasad  * Current MLA : Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy * Current ZPTC  * Current MPTC  * Current President  ==Sri Maragadhavalli Sameetha Shri Agastheeshwara Swamy Temple (Mukkoti) ==  The temple of Agastheeswara Swami is a sacred shrine that lies at the confluence of three rivers Swarnamukhi, Bhima and Kalyani in Chandragiri mandal.  The Siva lingam in this temple was installed by Agasthya Mahamuni and so it is called Agastheeswara lingam. This temple faces east and has almost all parivaradevathas installed in well-built places like Lord Ganesha, Lord Subramaniyam.  The temple has three entrances and a grand compound wall. The Dwarapalakas at the entrance of the sanctum sanctorum are beautifully sculptured. They stand tall to add grandeur to the hall. Inside the second prakara, there is a separate shrine for Mother Parvati called here by the name of Vallimata. There is a tank outside the compound for the convenience of visiting pilgrims. The nearby village was named Tondavada by the kings of Chandragiri, as it was the place used as a rest house for visitors and keeping elephants also.  Just opposite the Aalaya (temple) and in the middle of the river there is a mandapam built. In this, you can see the beautiful statues of Balaji, Ayyappa, Ganapati, etc., installed.   There is also a small shrine of Lord Sri Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Anjaneya that is built in recent times near the tank. All these places are worth visiting.  Sri Agastheswara Swamy Temple This temple has an inscription engraved on its wall. It is dated in the 31st year of Kulothunga Chola, but this is not a foundation inscription. This inscription may be helpful at best in setting the latter limit i.e. 1100-01 AD for its foundation. This temple square on plan has an ekatala and a square sikhara among the five types described above.  This temple may be classified under the type I represented by the Irugisvara temple at Yatavakili. The points of similarities are the square plan and the square sikhara, the absence of niches on the walls, niches with griva with nandis at the corners.  The most important difference however, is the protruding niche on the griva where the sthambha and the kirthimukha are more prominent and the placement of sculpture in the niches is subdued, while in the temple at Yatavakili the figure is more prominent, the sthambha is almost absent and the kirthimukha is less pronounced.  The niche appears to be an integral part of the griva in the Irugisvara temple at Yatavakili unlike in the Agasthyeswara temple. This is later in date than the Chandramalliswara temple at Yatavakili which, though renovated in the time of Rajaraja III. It appears to have retained the features of its original construction during the time of Rajendra I.  '''The uniqueness and rarity about this Temple''' Unlike other temples, here Goddess Maragadhavalli appears to the left hand side of Lord Agastheeshwara swamy temple resembling the sitting posture of a Bride and a Bride groom in a marriage as per the Hindu religious practice. This could be visualized in most ancient temples only.  Instead of Navagrahas, the Sapthamathrukas were installed here. They are Kowmari, Vaishnavi, Vaarahi, Bramhi, Mahedri, Mahishwari and Chamundi. The same blessings are available to those who worship the Sapthamathrukas instead of Navagrahas. If one visits this temple could realize the sanctity of the ancient temple.  * Distance: 8.5&nbsp;km from Tirupati, RTC Bus stand and 8&nbsp;km from Tirupati Railway station  ==Muthyalamma Temple == Muthyalamma temple is a shakti temple and villagers believe this goddess guard the village from the evil forms. This temple is more than 100 years and renovated in 1960 by Chirrareddy gari Krishna Reddy Family & Vadamala Family and by entire village in 2012.  ==Sri Rama Temple == <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SriRama Navami.jpg|thumb | upright | Sri Rama Navam Utsavam]] --> Sri Ram temple will be there any every village in India.

Licensed to  the city of [[Eugene, Oregon]], it serves the Eugene-[[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]] metropolitan area. The station is currently owned by [[Cumulus Media]], and affiliated with [[ABC News Radio]]. KUGN partners with local CBS television affiliate [[KVAL-TV|KVAL]] for breaking news and weather coverage.  KUGN is the flagship radio station of the Oregon Sports Network, and broadcasts [[University of Oregon]] football and basketball games. KUGN also broadcasts local high school football and basketball games. On weekdays, KUGN airs four-and-a-half hours of local news and talk programming, local and national news twice per hour, and nationally syndicated talk shows.  ==Programming== Talk programming includes:  *  ''KUGN Morning News'' with Storm Kennedy and Grant McHill *  [[Jonathan Brandmeier 9a to noon]] *  [[Michael Savage noon to 3p]] *  [[Mark Levin 3p-6p]] *  [[John Batchelor 6p-8p]] *  [[Seant Hannity 8p to 11p]] *  [[Jerry Doyle 11p to 1a]] *  [[Doug Stephan 1a to 5a]] *  [[Jim Bohanan 5ato 5:30a]] *  [[Bill Handel Wkends(Handel on the Law)]] *  [[Kim Komando Wkends]] *  ''Money Talk'' with [[Bob Brinker wkend]] *  [[Larry Kudlow wkend]] *  ''On The House'' with the Carey Brothers and Rebecca Cole wkend *  [[The Best of Clark, Savage and Batchelor]] *  [[Words of New Hope Sun 4p wkend]]  ==History== KUGN first took the air on July 4, 1946 as the second radio station in Eugene, after [[KORE]]. KUGN was originally affiliated with the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] radio network, but switched to [[NBC]] in December 1952. The station dropped the longtime NBC affiliation for [[CBS]] in December 1977.  In 1953, KUGN raised its power to 5,000-watts, to become the most powerful radio station in Oregon, outside of the Portland-metro area.<ref>Register Guard, November 16, 1953</ref>  In 1979, KUGN began airing some [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] programming, including [[Monday Night Football]] and [[Larry King]]'s popular evening talk show.  During its first four decades, KUGN was best known for its eclectic, personable announcers. The careers of such veterans as Duke Young, Dick Cross, Dave Miller, Russ Doran, Skip Hathaway, Webb Russell, Wendy Ray and Dale \"Uncle Fuzzy\" Reed spanned the period from the late 1950s to the early 1970s.  The station had the first traffic reports in the market in 1976 when Ken Strobeck did morning and afternoon drive-time reports in the \"KUGN Traffic Rabbit,\" a Volkswagen Rabbit equipped with a radio telephone and portable transmitter. Tom Lichty (\"Major Tom\") took over the job in late 1976 when traffic reporting took to the air, serving both as traffic reporter and pilot.  The \"old\" KUGN, which Ray unabashedly called \"the best radio station in the world,\" is best remembered for its popular \"Morning Show.\" Reed, KUGN's resident Renaissance Man, teamed with Ray and news director Fred Webb for a much beloved program that was a \"must hear\" in the Eugene area throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s.  \"The Morning Show\" entertained \"The Listener\" with such lighthearted semi-regular features such as Ray's \"Ball Score Boogie,\" the \"Poet's Nook\" starring Webb as the high-buttoned poetry devotee \"Charles,\" Lichty's traffic reports, and \"Gridpute,\" a tongue-in-cheek Friday morning football preview featuring Ray and a clanking, cantankerous \"computer.\"  Ray and Webb also teamed up on Eugene's top-rated morning newscasts, twice hourly between 5:30 and 10 a.m. D.J.-anchor \"Uncle Fuzzy\" knit it all together with his wry commentary and savvy music choices (adult contemporary with a fair amount of jazz), delivered in a voice that was airwave-polished, yet that of Everyman.  Ray retired from radio in March 1992.  Reed and Webb continued until that November, but management chose not to renew their contracts.<ref>Register Guard, November 10, 1992</ref>  The station experimented with a few replacements, before settling on a morning news team of Ralph Steadman and Rick Little.  Steadman exited in 1995 to make way for [[University of Oregon]] sportscaster Jerry Allen.<ref>Register Guard, September 2, 1995</ref>  Since 2010, The KUGN Morning News has been co-hosted by Storm Kennedy and Grant McHill.  ==Ownership== KUGN-AM was founded in 1946 by C.H. Fisher of Portland.  After some years, his children - Carl Fisher, Jane Whitbread, and Nancy Harrison - assumed daily operations of the station.  In 1972 Obie Advertising bought KUGN from the Fishers.  Obie was headed by Brian Obie, a future mayor of Eugene.<ref>Register Guard, August 4, 1972</ref>  Obie Advertising sold KUGN to Dallas-based Media Corp. of America in 1987.  Then in mid-1989, long-time employees Jim Torrey (also a future mayor of Eugene) and Chuck Chackel purchased KUGN for $4.2 million<ref>Register Guard, June 8, 1989</ref> and formed Combined Communications.  Torrey sold his interest in the company in 1991.<ref>Register Guard, April 8, 1997</ref>  In 1996, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] changed radio station ownership rules to allow companies to own up to six stations in a market (see [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]]).  Prior to 1996, companies could only own two FM and two AM stations per market.  Combined Communications took advantage of the new ownership rules and sold the station in 1996 to Deschutes Broadcasting for $7 million.  Over the next three years, the station passed hands from Deschutes to Citadel Broadcasting to Marathon Media, and finally, to Cumulus Broadcasting.  Cumulus also purchased five other stations in the Eugene area.  ==\"Home of the Ducks\"== In 1957, KUGN became the first flagship station of the [[University of Oregon]] sports radio network, with play-by-play announcer John Tasnady serving five seasons as the football \"Voice of the Ducks.\" KUGN morning host Wendy Ray, already a veteran sportscaster, took the microphone in 1960 as the Ducks' basketball announcer, when KUGN got the broadcast rights to that sport from local rival KASH.  When Tasnady retired from broadcasting prior to the 1962 football season, Ray stepped in as football announcer, and called both sports up through the 1969 Oregon-Oregon State \"Civil War\" football game. Color commentator Mike Guldager stepped in as play-by-play announcer for the season finale at Hawaii, and then announced Ducks basketball and football until 1973.  Ray returned to Oregon Ducks play-by-play for one season (1974–75) as football and basketball announcer. He also served as color commentator for new play-by-play announcer Warren Swain in the 1980 football season. Outside of radio, Ray was the longtime public address announcer for Oregon track and field meets at Hayward Field.  Other KUGN \"voices\" of University of Oregon sports were Bud Sobel (1973–74), Ralph Petti (football, 1975), Mike Stone (1975–80), Swain (1980–82), Portland sportscaster Bill Johnson (1982–84) and Hal Ramey (1984–87).  KUGN lost the broadcast rights to Duck sports in 1987, when the [[University of Oregon]] athletic department set up its own in-house radio network. The university put the network's flagship status up for bidding, and local rival [[KPNW]] won out over KUGN.<ref>Register Guard, December 12, 1989</ref>  During that time, KUGN became the flagship station for the Oregon State Beavers radio network, outbidding Portland station [[KEX-AM]].<ref>Register Guard, May 3, 1987</ref>  Eight years later, KUGN regained the broadcast rights to Duck sports. Play-by-play announcer Jerry Allen moved from KPNW to KUGN at that time.  Allen, a native Oregonian and veteran sportscaster, will begin his 28th season as \"Voice of the Ducks\" in the fall of 2014.  ==Former anchors and reporters== * [[Lars Larson]] * [[Delilah Rene]] * [[Joe Giansante]] * [[Wendy Ray]] * [[Dale \"Uncle Fuzzy\" Reed]] * [[Fred Webb]] * Bob Anderson * Mark Armstrong * Kristin Bailey * Tracy Berry * Jack Billings * Don Bishoff * Bob Boche * [[Dan Carlin]] * Dick Cross * Barbara Dellenback * Russ Doran * Brittany Durbin * Frank \"The Old Trader\" Ellington * Sarah Ferren * Jack Flemming * Russ Francis * [[Mike Guldager]] * Lester B.

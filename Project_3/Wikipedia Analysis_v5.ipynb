For simplicity and optimization purposes we will not be using the complete dataset for the analysis of the structure, but a smaller version instead. \nTo achieve this we will be using Apache Spark Dataframes to handle both the Wikipedia database and the intermediate results.

Extraction of relevant data\nNow that we have a rough idea of our dataset and have decreased its size to a more manageable subset, we will begin with our analysis.\n\nAs we mentioned previously and highlighted when displayed as a table, the most important information for our algorithm is stored in the columns named “title”, “id”, and “text”. \n- Title stores the title of the document (string)\n- ID stores the ID of the document (integer)\n- Text stores the content of the document (string)\n\nThis is intuitive when thinking about the purpose of the page rank algorithm, which is to rank web pages in their search engine results. In order to complete this task, the algorithm will need to know the name (title) of the page, what the page is about (text), and the unique identity of the page to distinguish it from others (ID). The most important piece of information for this algorithm is are the links that the page content (text) includes, as the rating of importance each page will recieve is a recursively defined measure whereby a page becomes important if important pages link to it.\n\nTo create the table containing the forward links, we have to first identify which are the outgoing links (identified with double \"[[]]\") and then select the ID rows for these hyperlinks. Further, we will be ignoring all external references and resources, such as images. \n\nThus, in this section we will focus on those three columns, and extract the key information from the text column, namely the links (identifiable as strings in brackets). To extract this information we will use regular expressions because regular expressions are a powerful tool to split texts into fragments.\n\nAs we will also be using Python functions that are not directly callable from the Spark Dataframe, we will be have to define some UDFs (user defined functions)."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"cd31eb72-1970-4bb6-b208-07ef53821922","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Implementation of the parse_links function to parse the links in the document body\n# This function recieves strings and returns returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, as a list of strings.

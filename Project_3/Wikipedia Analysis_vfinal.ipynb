For simplicity and optimization purposes we will not be using the complete dataset for the analysis of the structure, but a smaller version instead. \nTo achieve this we will be using Apache Spark Dataframes to handle both the Wikipedia database and the intermediate results.

Extraction of relevant data\nNow that we have a rough idea of our dataset and have decreased its size to a more manageable subset, we will begin with our analysis.\n\nAs we mentioned previously and highlighted when displayed as a table, the most important information for our algorithm is stored in the columns named “title”, “id”, and “text”. \n- Title stores the title of the document (string)\n- ID stores the ID of the document (integer)\n- Text stores the content of the document (string)\n\nThis is intuitive when thinking about the purpose of the page rank algorithm, which is to rank web pages in their search engine results. In order to complete this task, the algorithm will need to know the name (title) of the page, what the page is about (text), and the unique identity of the page to distinguish it from others (ID). The most important piece of information for this algorithm is are the links that the page content (text) includes, as the rating of importance each page will recieve is a recursively defined measure whereby a page becomes important if important pages link to it.\n\nTo create the table containing the forward links, we have to first identify which are the outgoing links (identified with double \"[[]]\") and then select the ID rows for these hyperlinks. Further, we will be ignoring all external references and resources, such as images. \n\nThus, in this section we will focus on those three columns, and extract the key information from the text column, namely the links (identifiable as strings in brackets). To extract this information we will use regular expressions because regular expressions are a powerful tool to split texts into fragments.\n\nAs we will also be using Python functions that are not directly callable from the Spark Dataframe, we will be have to define some UDFs (user defined functions)."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"2e2a16c2-ad6f-424e-9ea0-ad15ece5ae3e","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Implementation of the parse_links function to parse the links in the document body\n# This function recieves strings and returns returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, as a list of strings.

Conclusions\n\nOur implementation of the algorithm is a simplified version of page rank algorithm created and used by google. Before performing it on the data, a number of preparation steps had to be performed in order to obtain dataframes to work on. \n\nFirst step was uploading the data. We used databricks file, so we could import it directly from there. Parquet is a columnar storage format for big data. It is designed to be highly efficient for both reading and writing large datasets. A Parquet file is a binary file format that stores data in a columnar format. This means that data is organized into columns rather than rows, and each column is stored separately. This allows for more efficient compression and encoding of the data, as well as more efficient querying, because only the columns needed for a particular query need to be read from disk.\n\nFor time-saving purposes we used only a fraction of a whole dataset. It contains over 5 milion of rows containing wikipedia pages information. Then we retrieved only usefull columns and parsed the links that were relevant for the algorithm. Next steps included creating *forward dataframe*: dataframe with link ids and lists of links that those pages forward to, and *reverse dataframe*: dataframe with link ids and lists of pages forwarding to this specific pages. These were crucial for performing the algorithm. They are described in detail in proper places in the notebook. User defined functions can be found everywhere across the notebook. They allow to apply a function to a column in spark dataframe quickly.\n\nAs we observe the results of the algorithm, we can see that they don't vary too much. At first we expected more differences between the calculated values. Then, after closer analysys, we came to conclusion that little variance between the values is a consequence of drastical shrinkening of data size. Taking only 0.001 of all records of wikipedia dataset caused a lot of pages having a little number of other pages forwarding to them, so their rank didn't change. Those values should vary more while performing the algorithm on bigger chunk or the whole dataset. Setting the proper thershold is a thing while performing the calculae. Choosing bigger threshold allows to get more stable ranks, but also requires more iterations to compute. For testing the implementation we chose the one that made the calculations quicker."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"6433e0d5-d229-432c-8bd2-d1f8bc32208b","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"version":"3.8.11","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"application/vnd.databricks.v1+notebook":{"notebookName":"Wikipedia Analysis_vfinal","dashboards":[],"notebookMetadata":{"pythonIndentUnit":2,"mostRecentlyExecutedCommandWithImplicitDF":{"commandId":2896898850173517,"dataframes":["_sqldf"]}},"language":"python","widgets":{},"notebookOrigID":2896898850173508}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
